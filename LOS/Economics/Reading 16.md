## Reading 16 — Introduction to Geopolitics

*(Economics | CFA Level I)*

Below is a **LOS-by-LOS cheat-sheet** for Reading 16, illustrated with India-centric cases, quick CFA exam pointers, and highlight boxes for can’t-miss details. (There are *no quantitative formulas* in this reading, so the “formula sheet” notes that explicitly.)

---

### LOS 16.a Describe geopolitics from a cooperation-versus-competition lens&#x20;

Geopolitics looks at how **state actors** (governments) and **non-state actors** (multinationals, NGOs, individuals) interact on a spectrum:

| Spectrum end        | Tag line                           | Indian example                                                                              |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cooperative**     | “Win-win” diplomacy & open borders | India’s **International Solar Alliance** invites >120 nations to share green-tech know-how. |
| **Non-cooperative** | “My interests first”               | 2022 wheat-export ban to protect domestic food security.                                    |

**Tip:** Sketch the spectrum on scratch paper—questions sometimes ask, *“Country X’s ban on rare-earth exports is most likely cooperative or non-cooperative?”*

### LOS 16.b Contrast nationalism vs. globalization (autarky, hegemony, bilateralism, multilateralism)&#x20;

| Quadrant            | Cooperation? | Globalisation? | One-liner memory hook    | Indian cue                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Autarky**         | ❌            | ❌              | “Go it alone”            | N-Korea style self-reliance (not India)          |
| **Hegemony**        | ❌            | ✅              | “My way or the highway”  | Cold-War superpower blocs                        |
| **Bilateralism**    | ✅            | ❌              | “Friend-to-friend deals” | **India–UAE CEPA** 2022 (zero-tariff fast track) |
| **Multilateralism** | ✅            | ✅              | “All in—global rules”    | **WTO**, **Quad vaccines initiative**            |

**Exam hack:** A vignette with two-country tariff reciprocity → classify as *bilateralism*.

### LOS 16.c Explain the roles of major international organisations&#x20;

| Body                 | Core mandate                                            | Quick India tie-in                                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IMF**              | Exchange-rate stability; balance-of-payments assistance | India tapped IMF in 1991 crisis; reforms followed.                     |
| **World Bank Group** | Long-term development finance to cut poverty            | Funds metro rail & rural roads (PMGSY) projects.                       |
| **WTO**              | Set & police global trade rules                         | India led farm-subsidy negotiations & patent waiver push during COVID. |

**Hot spot:** MCQs love to mix up IMF vs World Bank—remember *IMF = short-term BoP doctor; WB = long-term development architect*.

### LOS 16.d Classify geopolitical risks&#x20;

| Risk bucket           | Definition                       | Indian illustration                                                 | “Velocity”         |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Event**             | Known date, uncertain outcome    | 2024 General Elections                                              | Medium             |
| **Exogenous (shock)** | Unanticipated bolt-from-the-blue | 2019 **Balakot air-strike** escalation                              | Very high          |
| **Thematic**          | Slow-burn, long-term drivers     | China–U.S. tech-fragmentation; India ‘China + 1’ supply-chain shift | Low but persistent |

**CFA pointer:** Item-sets often ask you to pick *which* risk is relevant to a long-horizon pension fund—answer = thematic.

### LOS 16.e Identify tools of geopolitics&#x20;

| Bucket                | Cooperative examples          | Non-cooperative examples                   | India context |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| **National-security** | Joint naval drills (Malabar)  | Border troop build-ups                     |               |
| **Economic**          | Free-trade area (SAFTA)       | **Voluntary Export Restraints** on sugar   |               |
| **Financial**         | Currency-swap lines (RBI–BoJ) | **Sanctions** on Russian banks (SWIFT ban) |               |

**Exam cue:** “VER” (voluntary export restraint) is *non-cooperative economic*—easy point if you memorise the table!

### LOS 16.f Analyse likelihood, impact, and velocity of risks&#x20;

A disciplined framework:

1. **Likelihood** – How probable? (e.g., minor skirmish vs full-scale war)
2. **Impact** – Portfolio sensitivity (oil producers vs IT exporters).
3. **Velocity** – Speed of price discovery; event & exogenous move fastest.

Portfolio manager playbook for an Indian equity fund:

* **Stress-test** oil import costs for Strait-of-Hormuz blockade scenario.
* **Hedge** rupee with USDINR futures for election volatility.
* **Tilt** toward domestic demand sectors (FMCG) during global trade rifts.

## 📑 “Formula” Sheet – Reading 16

> *There are no numerical formulas in this reading.* Instead, memorise the **risk buckets, tool types, and 4-quadrant geopolitical map**.

---

## 🚀 Quick Exam-Day Pointers

1. **Tables trump prose**—re-draw the four-quadrant map & risk buckets on scratch first.
2. Watch keywords: *“voluntary export restraint”* ➔ non-cooperative economic tool.
3. IMF vs WB vs WTO mix-ups are common—link IMF to BoP loans, WB to long-term development, WTO to dispute resolution.
4. When asked which risk matters for a long-term investor, answer **thematic** (unless time horizon is explicitly short).
5. No math here—use Reading 16 as a “breather” but bag every free point by rote-learning the classifications.

You now have a crisp, India-flavoured roadmap for Reading 16. Drill the tables, rehearse the examples, and these six LOS will be easy marks on exam day!
