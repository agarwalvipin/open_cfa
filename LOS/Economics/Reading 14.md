## Reading 14 ‚Äî Fiscal Policy

*(Economics Topic Area | CFA Level I)*

Below you‚Äôll find a **LOS-by-LOS walkthrough** of Reading 14, enriched with relatable real-world (especially Indian) illustrations, CFA exam tips, and must-remember highlights.

### LOS 14.a‚ÄÇCompare monetary and fiscal policy &#x20;

| Aspect                    | Fiscal Policy                                                                                                                   | Monetary Policy                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Authority**             | Elected government (Union Budget‚ÄîMoF in India; Congress/Treasury in U.S.)                                                       | Central bank (RBI, Fed, ECB)                                                        |
| **Primary tools**         | Expenditure & taxation decisions                                                                                                | Policy rates, reserve requirements, open-market ops                                 |
| **Typical goals**         | Influence **aggregate demand (AD)**, redistribute income, guide long-run growth                                                 | **Price stability**, output gap smoothing, lender-of-last-resort                    |
| **Speed / lags**          | **Inside lag** short (policy can be announced in the Budget) but **outside lag** long‚Äîexecution via ministries, tendering, etc. | Opposite: committee meets quickly but transmission (bank lending rates) can be slow |
| **Coordination pitfalls** | Fiscal expansion while RBI tightens can create ‚Äúcrowding-out‚Äù pressure on private credit                                        | Loose monetary + lax fiscal may trigger twin-deficit & currency run                 |

#### Indian Touch üîç

* **2020‚Äì21 pandemic response:** GoI launched the ‚Çπ 20 lakh cr Atmanirbhar Bharat package (fiscal), while RBI executed emergency rate cuts and LTROs (monetary), exemplifying coordinated but distinct roles.

**Exam-day nugget:** Know **who controls what** and the *direction* in which each policy shifts the AD curve. Quick sketch in the margin saves precious seconds.

### LOS 14.b‚ÄÇDescribe roles/objectives of fiscal policy & the debt-to-GDP debate‚ÄÇ

1. **Resource allocation** ‚Äì e.g., capital-expenditure push for Indian Railways reallocates resources toward infrastructure.
2. **Income redistribution** ‚Äì progressive income-tax slabs, PM-KISAN cash transfers.
3. **Economic stabilization** ‚Äì counter-cyclical ‚Äúautomatic stabilisers‚Äù (GST collections fall in slowdown ‚Üí deficit widens without new legislation).

**Does debt-to-GDP matter?**

* **Key argument yes:** High debt crowds out private investment & may raise sovereign risk premium (India‚Äôs FRBM Act targets ‚â§40 % by FY 25‚Äì26).
* **Key argument no:** If r < g (real interest < real GDP growth) debt stabilises naturally; Japan often cited.

> **Hot-button for exam:** Be able to state both sides and link to *inter-generational equity*.

### LOS 14.c‚ÄÇDescribe fiscal policy tools, with pros & cons‚ÄÇ

| Tool                    | Expansionary use           | Advantage                     | Disadvantage                           | India Example                     |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Government spending** | ‚Üë capex (roads, defence)   | High multiplier               | Time-consuming project cycle           | Bharatmala highway programme      |
| **Transfer payments**   | ‚Üë cash to households       | Immediate boost to C          | May be saved, not spent                | PM-KISAN, MNREGA wage hikes       |
| **Direct taxes**        | ‚Üì personal / corporate tax | Quick to legislate            | Smaller multiplier vs. spending        | 2019 corp-tax cut to 22 %         |
| **Indirect taxes**      | ‚Üì GST rates                | Fast, administratively simple | Revenue erosion, potential distortions | GST rate cuts on auto sector 2019 |

> **Exam hint:** Memorise relative **fiscal multipliers**: *Govt spending > Transfer > Tax cuts.*

### LOS 14.d‚ÄÇExplain implementation challenges & classify stance‚ÄÇ

| Implementation Difficulty | Real-world Illustration (India)                                                         |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Recognition lag**       | Quarterly GDP revision delays; demonetisation shock initially underestimated.           |
| **Action lag**            | Passing Finance Bill through Parliament; state road projects awaiting land acquisition. |
| **Impact/Outside lag**    | Capex multiplier unfolds over years (Delhi‚ÄìMumbai Expressway still under construction). |
| **Political constraints** | Populist loan-waiver schemes before elections may bias toward deficits.                 |
| **Forecast errors**       | Over-optimistic GST revenue assumptions widened FY 19‚Äì20 deficit.                       |

**Classifying the stance:**

* Expansionary if cyclically-adjusted/budget‚Äêbalance deteriorates (e.g., FY 21 deficit ballooning to 9.2 % of GDP).
* Contractionary if surplus rises or deficit shrinks in boom (FRBM path FY 18).

> **Exam-day pointer:** Adjust for **automatic stabilisers** to judge stance; quote *structural* vs *actual* deficit.

## üìë Formula Sheet ‚Äì Reading 14

| Concept                          | Formula                                              |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fiscal (spending) multiplier** | $k_G = \dfrac{1}{1 - MPC(1 - t)}$                    |
| **Tax multiplier**               | $k_T = -\dfrac{MPC}{1 - MPC(1 - t)}$                 |
| **Balanced-budget multiplier**   | $k_{BB} = k_G + k_T = 1$                             |
| **Budget balance**               | Primary balance = Revenue ‚Äì (Expenditure ‚Äì Interest) |
| **Debt sustainability**          | ŒîDebt/GDP ‚âà (r ‚Äì g) √ó Debt/GDP‚Çç‚Çã‚ÇÅ‚Çé ‚Äì Primary balance |

*(MPC = marginal propensity to consume, t = marginal tax rate)*

## üöÄ Quick Exam-Day Pointers

1. **Know automatic vs. discretionary stabilisers**‚Äîquick ‚Äúexpand-contract‚Äù table in memory.
2. **Watch wording:** ‚Äú*most likely expansionary*‚Äù usually implies ‚ÜëG or ‚ÜìT **without offset**.
3. **Multipliers:** spending > transfer > tax; sign matters (tax multiplier negative).
4. **Lag taxonomy:** recognition ‚Üí action ‚Üí impact; monetary opposite in length.
5. **Debt danger signal:** if r > g and persistent primary deficit ‚áí unsustainable path.
6. **Illustrative numbers:** be able to plug MPC = 0.8 into formulas in 30 seconds.

### üåü Final Tip

Write a **micro cheat-sheet** the night before: include the multiplier formulas, lag sequence, and automatic-stabiliser examples‚Äî stick it on the back of your BA II Plus case for a last-minute glance outside the test hall!

‚ÄîGood luck, Vipin! You‚Äôve got the roadmap‚Äînow drill the concepts and practice till they‚Äôre second nature.
