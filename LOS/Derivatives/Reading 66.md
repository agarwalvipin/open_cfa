### Module 66.1: Derivatives Markets

This module covers the fundamental definition of a derivative, its basic features, and the two primary types of markets where these instruments are traded.

#### What is a Derivative? (LOS 66.a)

A **derivative** is a financial instrument whose value is *derived* from the value of something else. That "something else" is called the **underlying**.

Think of it like a betting slip on a cricket match. The slip itself has no intrinsic worth, but its value is derived from the outcome of the match (the underlying event).

**Key Features of a Derivative Contract:**

* **Underlying:** The asset, index, or rate the contract is based on. This could be a stock (like Reliance Industries), a commodity (like gold), an interest rate, or a stock market index (like the Nifty 50).
* **Price:** The price at which the future transaction will occur (e.g., forward price or an option's exercise price).
* **Notional Amount:** The size of the contract (e.g., 100 shares, 1 kg of gold).
* **Settlement Date:** The future date when the contract expires and the transaction occurs.
* **Settlement Method:**
    * **Physical Delivery:** The actual underlying asset is exchanged.
    * **Cash Settlement:** The net profit or loss is paid in cash, which is far more common for financial derivatives.

For forward commitments like forwards and futures, the contract price is set such that the **value of the contract at initiation is zero** to both parties. This is a crucial point‚Äîno one pays anything to enter the contract itself (though a collateral deposit, or margin, may be required).

#### Exchange-Traded vs. OTC Markets (LOS 66.b)

Derivatives trade in two distinct types of markets. Understanding their differences is essential.

**üèõÔ∏è Exchange-Traded Derivatives (ETD)**

These are the derivatives you see traded publicly. Think of the Futures & Options (F&O) segment of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in India.

* **Standardized:** Contracts are completely standardized. The contract size, expiration date, and underlying are all pre-defined by the exchange, offering no flexibility.
* **Centralized Exchange:** All trading occurs on a formal, regulated exchange.
* **Clearinghouse:** The exchange's clearinghouse acts as the middleman for all trades, becoming the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer. This **eliminates counterparty risk**‚Äîthe risk that the other party will default. This is their single most important feature.
* **Transparent & Liquid:** All prices and trading volumes are public information, and it's easy to enter or exit a position due to high trading volumes, 2921].

---

**ü§ù Over-The-Counter (OTC) Derivatives**

These are private contracts negotiated directly between two parties, away from a public exchange.

* **Customized:** Contracts are tailored to the specific needs of the two parties. They can agree on any underlying, notional amount, or settlement date they wish.
* **Decentralized Dealer Market:** There is no central location; it's a network of large banks and financial institutions.
* **Counterparty Risk:** This is the primary risk. Because it's a private deal, you are exposed to the risk that your counterparty might go bankrupt and be unable to fulfill their side of the agreement.
* **Less Transparent & Liquid:** The terms of the deal are private, and it can be difficult to exit or transfer the contract to someone else.

> **CFA Exam Tip:** This comparison between ETD and OTC markets is a very common exam topic. Know the trade-offs: ETDs offer security and liquidity at the cost of flexibility. OTC markets offer flexibility at the cost of higher counterparty risk and lower liquidity.

### Summary of Key Concepts for Reading 66

This introductory reading is all about definitions and classifications. There are no formulas, so focus on the core concepts.

* **Derivative Definition:** A financial instrument whose value is **derived** from an underlying asset, rate, or index.
* **Basic Features:** Every derivative has an **underlying**, a **notional amount** (size), a pre-agreed **price**, and a future **settlement date**, 2889].
* **Settlement:** Contracts can be settled by **physical delivery** of the asset or, more commonly, by a **cash settlement** of the net profit or loss.
* **Primary Uses:**
    * **Hedging:** Using derivatives to reduce or eliminate an existing risk.
    * **Speculating:** Using derivatives to take on risk in the hope of making a profit.
* **Two Main Market Types:**
    * **Exchange-Traded (ETD):** Standardized contracts traded on a central, regulated exchange with a clearinghouse that eliminates counterparty risk, 2917, 2919].
    * **Over-the-Counter (OTC):** Customized, private contracts negotiated directly between two parties, which carry counterparty risk.

### ‚ö° Quick Exam-Day Pointers

For Reading 66 questions, focus on identifying the correct definition or classification.

* **Derived Value is Key:** The name says it all. A derivative's value is not intrinsic; it depends on something else (the underlying), 2886].
* **Price ‚â† Value (at the start):** For forward commitments like futures, the contract **price** (e.g., ‚Çπ5,000 per gram of gold) is set so that the contract's **value** is **zero** when you first enter it. Don't mix these up!
* **ETD vs. OTC: The Big Showdown:** This is the most important concept in the reading. Remember the trade-off:
    * üèõÔ∏è **Exchange-Traded = Standardized + Safe.** Think of it as buying a ready-made product from a big, secure store. The clearinghouse is your security guard, eliminating counterparty risk, 2913, 2919].
    * ü§ù **OTC = Customized + Risky.** Think of it as getting a custom-tailored suit. It fits your needs perfectly, but you're relying on the reputation and creditworthiness of the tailor (your counterparty), 2923].
* **Who is the Hero? The Clearinghouse!** The exam may ask what feature of exchange-traded markets mitigates risk. The answer is the **central clearinghouse (CCH)**, which guarantees performance on all contracts, 2919].
