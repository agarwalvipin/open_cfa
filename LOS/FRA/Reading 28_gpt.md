## LOS 28.a‚ÄÉRevenue recognition

| **Key points**                                                                                                            | **Indian illustration**                                                                                                                                                                   | **Exam pointers**                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Revenue is recorded **when control passes** to the customer (5-step model) and **not** when cash is received.             | *Infosys* bills a three-year cloud-migration contract. Each milestone is a ‚Äúperformance obligation‚Äù; revenue is booked as code is delivered, even though clients often pay 30 days later. | ‚Ä¢ Memorise the 5 steps.<br>‚Ä¢ IFRS = Ind AS 115; same rules. Expect 1-2 MCQs on long-term contracts vs. point-in-time sales. |
| **Variable consideration** (e.g., trade discounts, returns) is constrained to amounts ‚Äúhighly probable‚Äù of not reversing. | *Avenue Supermarts (DMart)* recognises revenue net of expected festive-season returns.                                                                                                    | **Watch for** ‚Äúhighly probable‚Äù trigger word in questions.                                                                  |

#### Implications for analysis

* Aggressive policies shift revenue forward ‚Üí higher margins, receivables spike.
* Use **Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)** to detect it.

## LOS 28.b‚ÄÉExpense recognition & capitalisation

| Principle                                                                                                | Example (India)                                                                                               | Analyst angle                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Matching** ‚Äì recognise costs in the same period as the revenue they generate.                          | *Maruti Suzuki* estimates warranty expense at sale-date, not when cars return for repair.                     | Compare warranty %-of-sales to peers (Tata Motors, Mahindra).                 |
| **Period costs** ‚Äì admin, head-office rent, R\&D (under US-GAAP) ‚Üí expense immediately.                  | *HDFC Bank* head-office lease shows up in ‚ÄúOther Opex‚Äù.                                                       | High period costs depress current profit but may signal investment in growth. |
| **Capitalise vs. expense** ‚Äì Costs providing future benefit are capitalised, then depreciated/amortised. | *Reliance Jio* capitalises fibre-optic rollout, amortises over 20 yrs; training costs for staff are expensed. | Capitalising raises assets & equity first year ‚Üí watch ROE ‚Äúpop‚Äù then fade.   |

**Exam tips**

* IFRS permits development-phase R\&D capitalisation if six criteria met.
* **Interest during construction** ‚Üí capitalised (Ind AS 23). Add it back when calculating **FCFF interest coverage**.
* Know table comparing **capitalise** vs. **expense** impacts on IS/BS/CFS.

## LOS 28.c‚ÄÉNon-recurring items & accounting changes

### 1. Discontinued operations

* Must be **physically & operationally distinct**; results shown **net-of-tax below** continuing ops.
* Ex: *ITC* spun off its lifestyle retail arm; numbers restated for prior periods.

### 2. Unusual / infrequent items

* Impairments, restructuring charges (e.g., *Wipro* exit from data-centre business) ‚Üí reported **pre-tax** within continuing ops.

### 3. Changes

| Change type                                            | Treatment                                    | Remember                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Accounting policy** (e.g., switch FIFO‚Üíweighted-avg) | **Retrospective** ‚Äì restate prior years.     | CFA often tests whether equity is adjusted. |
| **Estimate** (useful life)                             | **Prospective** ‚Äì no restatement.            | Only future depreciation changes.           |
| **Error**                                              | Prior-period adjustment; restate & disclose. | Seen in mock exams!                         |

## LOS 28.d‚ÄÉBasic & Diluted EPS

| Formula                                                                      | Notes                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Basic EPS** = (Net income ‚Äì Preferred dividends) / *Wtd-avg* common shares | Stock splits & dividends ‚Üí restate prior share data.                                                                                           |
| **Diluted EPS** (complex structure)                                          | Add convertible dividends/interest (after-tax) to numerator; add potential shares (options, convertibles) to denominator **only if dilutive**. |

### Mnemonics

*‚ÄúIf-Converted‚Äù for bonds & prefs; ‚ÄúTreasury-Stock Method‚Äù for options/warrants.*

#### Quick Indian snapshot

* *TCS* reports only **basic EPS** (simple structure).
* *Adani Ports* shows large gap between basic & diluted due to convertible debt‚Äîcheck for **antidilutive** impact before adding.

## LOS 28.e‚ÄÉCommon-size IS & ratios

| Tool                     | How                                    | Insight                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Vertical common-size** | Express each line as % of **revenue**. | Compare *Bharti Airtel* vs *Vodafone-Idea* cost structures.                    |
| **Margins**              | Gross, Operating, Net, Pretax.         | Falling net margin with flat operating margin ‚Üí rising financing costs or tax. |
| **Effective tax rate**   | Tax / Pretax income.                   | Domestic IT firms enjoy **MAT credit**‚Äîexpect lower rate.                      |

## Real-world Indian walk-through

Imagine *Dabur India Ltd.* (FMCG):

1. **Revenue** recognised when goods delivered to distributors (LOS a).
2. **COGS** matches cost of ayurvedic ingredients purchased earlier (LOS b).
3. **Inventory write-off** of obsolete SKUs reported as unusual item, impacts margin (LOS c).
4. Issues ESOPs ‚Üí potential 5 million shares; analyst tests for dilution (LOS d).
5. Converts IS to common-size: Ad spend 11 % vs. 13 % for *HUL* (LOS e).

## üîë Quick exam-day pointers

* **Write ‚ÄúRevenue = transfer of control‚Äù** on your scratch sheet.
* **EPS:** Always test **dilutive vs. antidilutive**‚Äîif EPS ‚Üë after conversion, **ignore** security.
* Inventory or depreciation estimates ‚Üí change **prospectively**.
* **FIFO vs. LIFO** impacts show up in Reading 32 but can bleed into IS ratios‚Äîknow which gives higher COGS in inflation.
* When stuck, remember: *Cash flow trumps accruals*‚Äîuse CFO to sanity-check profit.

üü¢ Good luck, Vipin! Focus on understanding the flow‚Äîquestions rarely require heavy calc, but often test the **logic** behind recognition and classification.
