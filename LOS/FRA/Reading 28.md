## a. Revenue Recognition

### **General Principles**

Revenue recognition is a cornerstone of accrual accounting. [cite\_start]The core principle, under both IFRS and U.S. GAAP, is to recognize revenue when it is earned, which may not be when the cash is received[cite: 3780]. [cite\_start]The converged standard on revenue recognition (IFRS 15 and ASC 606) outlines a five-step process for recognizing revenue[cite: 2983, 3805]:

1.  [cite\_start]**Identify the contract(s) with a customer.** A contract is an agreement between two or more parties that specifies their obligations and rights[cite: 2983].
2.  [cite\_start]**Identify the performance obligations in the contract.** A performance obligation is a promise to deliver a distinct good or service[cite: 3785].
3.  [cite\_start]**Determine the transaction price.** This is the amount a firm expects to receive from a customer[cite: 3788].
4.  **Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations.**
5.  **Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.**

### **Specific Revenue Recognition Applications**

Let's look at some real-world applications in the Indian context:

  * **Long-Term Contracts:** Consider an Indian infrastructure company like **Larsen & Toubro (L\&T)**, which undertakes long-term construction projects. L\&T cannot wait until a multi-year project is complete to recognize revenue. [cite\_start]Instead, it recognizes revenue over time based on the percentage of completion[cite: 3792, 3795]. [cite\_start]This is typically measured by the proportion of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs of the project[cite: 3794, 3795].

  * **Franchise Agreements:** Imagine **Jubilant FoodWorks**, which operates Domino's Pizza in India. When it sells a new franchise, the initial franchise fee is not recognized as revenue immediately. [cite\_start]This fee is deferred and recognized over the life of the franchise agreement[cite: 3799]. [cite\_start]However, the ongoing royalty payments from the franchisee are recognized as revenue in the period they are earned[cite: 3800].

  * **Software Licenses vs. Subscriptions:** An Indian IT giant like **Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)** might sell software in two ways. [cite\_start]If it sells a perpetual license where the customer installs the software on their own systems, the revenue is recognized at the point of sale[cite: 3802]. [cite\_start]However, if TCS provides a cloud-based subscription service (Software as a Service - SaaS), the revenue is recognized over the subscription period[cite: 3802].

### **Implications for Financial Analysis & Exam Tips**

  * **Aggressive vs. Conservative Recognition:** Be wary of companies that recognize revenue too aggressively. For example, a company might ship goods to a distributor at the end of a quarter and recognize revenue, even if the distributor has the right to return the goods. This is a red flag.
  * **Disclosures are Key:** Always read the revenue recognition policy in the notes to the financial statements. It provides crucial details about the company's accounting choices.
  * **Exam Tip:** The CFA exam will likely test your understanding of the five-step model and its application to different scenarios. Be prepared to identify the correct timing of revenue recognition. The distinction between recognizing revenue at a point in time versus over time is a common exam topic.

## b. Expense Recognition

### **General Principles**

[cite\_start]Expense recognition is governed by the **matching principle**, which dictates that expenses should be recognized in the same period as the revenues they help generate[cite: 3810]. This is crucial for accurately measuring a company's profitability.

### **Specific Expense Recognition Applications**

  * [cite\_start]**Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** When a retailer like **Reliance Retail** sells a product, the cost of that product is recognized as COGS at the time of sale, not when the inventory was purchased[cite: 3812].
  * [cite\_start]**Warranty Costs:** When a company like **Bajaj Auto** sells a motorcycle with a warranty, it must estimate the future warranty costs and recognize them as an expense in the period of the sale[cite: 3814]. This is an example of matching an estimated expense to the revenue it helped generate.
  * **Depreciation:** When **Infosys** buys a new office building, the cost of the building is not expensed immediately. Instead, it is capitalized as an asset and then depreciated over its useful life. The annual depreciation charge is an expense that reflects the portion of the asset's cost used up in that period.

### **Capitalizing vs. Expensing**

This is a critical concept.

  * [cite\_start]**Capitalizing:** An expenditure is capitalized if it's expected to provide a future economic benefit over multiple accounting periods[cite: 3827]. [cite\_start]The cost is recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and then expensed over time (e.g., through depreciation or amortization)[cite: 3829].
  * [cite\_start]**Expensing:** If the future economic benefit is unlikely or uncertain, the expenditure is expensed in the period incurred[cite: 3828].

**Impact of Capitalizing vs. Expensing:**

| **Metric** | **Capitalizing** | **Expensing** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Net Income (Year 1)** | Higher | Lower |
| **Net Income (Later Years)** | Lower | Higher |
| **Total Assets** | Higher | Lower |
| **Shareholders' Equity** | Higher | Lower |
| **Cash Flow from Operations (CFO)** | Higher | Lower |
| **Cash Flow from Investing (CFI)** | Lower | Higher |
| **Income Variability** | Lower | Higher |
| **Debt-to-Equity** | Lower | Higher |
[cite\_start][cite: 3862]

### **Implications for Financial Analysis & Exam Tips**

  * **Comparability:** Companies in the same industry may have different capitalization policies. An analyst must be aware of these differences to make meaningful comparisons. For instance, some software companies might capitalize development costs while others expense them, leading to different reported profits and asset bases.
  * **Exam Tip:** The exam loves to test the impact of capitalizing vs. expensing on financial statements and ratios. Be sure to memorize the table above. You should be able to state, for example, that capitalizing a cost leads to higher net income in the first year but lower net income in subsequent years compared to expensing.

## c. Non-Recurring Items and Changes in Accounting Policies

### **Non-Recurring Items**

These are items that are not expected to occur regularly. They are important for analysts because they need to be excluded when forecasting a company's future earnings.

  * [cite\_start]**Discontinued Operations:** This refers to a component of an entity that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale[cite: 3887]. The income or loss from discontinued operations is reported separately on the income statement, *net of tax*, after income from continuing operations. This allows analysts to focus on the part of the business that will continue to generate profits in the future.
  * [cite\_start]**Unusual or Infrequent Items:** These are events that are either unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence[cite: 3885]. [cite\_start]Examples include gains or losses from the sale of assets, restructuring costs, and impairments[cite: 3886]. [cite\_start]These items are reported *pre-tax* as part of income from continuing operations[cite: 3886].

### **Changes in Accounting Policies and Estimates**

  * **Change in Accounting Principle:** This occurs when a company changes from one acceptable accounting method to another (e.g., changing inventory valuation from FIFO to weighted average). [cite\_start]Such changes require **retrospective application**, meaning prior years' financial statements are restated to reflect the new policy[cite: 3890].
  * **Change in Accounting Estimate:** This is a change in an estimate based on new information (e.g., changing the estimated useful life of an asset). [cite\_start]These changes are applied **prospectively**, meaning they only affect the current and future periods[cite: 3892].
  * **Correction of an Error:** Correcting a material error from a prior period requires a **prior-period adjustment**, which involves restating the prior period's financial statements.

### **Implications for Financial Analysis & Exam Tips**

  * **"Below-the-line" vs. "Above-the-line":** Discontinued operations are reported "below the line" (i.e., after income from continuing operations). Unusual or infrequent items are "above the line."
  * **Exam Tip:** The distinction between retrospective and prospective application is a key exam topic. Remember: changes in principle are retrospective, while changes in estimate are prospective.

## d. Earnings Per Share (EPS)

EPS is a widely used measure of a company's profitability on a per-share basis.

### **Basic EPS**

This is calculated for companies with a **simple capital structure** (i.e., no potentially dilutive securities).

**Formula for Basic EPS:**

```
(Net Income - Preferred Dividends) / Weighted Average Number of Common Shares Outstanding
```

[cite\_start][cite: 3906]

[cite\_start]The **weighted average number of shares** is used to account for changes in the number of shares outstanding during the period (e.g., due to share issuances or buybacks)[cite: 3910].

### **Diluted EPS**

This is calculated for companies with a **complex capital structure** (i.e., with potentially dilutive securities like convertible bonds, convertible preferred stock, or stock options). Diluted EPS shows the "worst-case" scenario for EPS if all dilutive securities were converted into common stock.

  * **Convertible Preferred Stock:** If dilutive, the preferred dividends are added back to the numerator, and the number of common shares that would be issued upon conversion is added to the denominator.
  * **Convertible Debt:** If dilutive, the after-tax interest expense on the debt is added back to the numerator, and the number of common shares that would be issued upon conversion is added to the denominator.
  * [cite\_start]**Stock Options and Warrants:** The **treasury stock method** is used[cite: 3954]. This method assumes that the proceeds from the exercise of options are used to repurchase shares at the average market price. The net increase in shares is added to the denominator.

[cite\_start]**Antidilutive Securities:** A security is antidilutive if its inclusion in the diluted EPS calculation would *increase* EPS[cite: 3925]. Antidilutive securities are *not* included in the calculation of diluted EPS.

### **Implications for Financial Analysis & Exam Tips**

  * **Diluted EPS is More Conservative:** For companies with complex capital structures, diluted EPS is a more conservative measure of profitability than basic EPS.
  * **Exam Tip:** The CFA exam will definitely have questions on calculating basic and diluted EPS. You need to be comfortable with the formulas and the treasury stock method. Remember to check if securities are dilutive or antidilutive before including them in the calculation.

## e. Common-Size Income Statements and Financial Ratios

### **Common-Size Income Statements**

[cite\_start]A common-size income statement expresses each line item as a percentage of revenue[cite: 2987]. This is an incredibly useful tool for:

  * **Time-Series Analysis:** Comparing a company's performance over several years to identify trends.
  * [cite\_start]**Cross-Sectional Analysis:** Comparing a company to its competitors, even if they are of different sizes[cite: 2989].

For example, by looking at the common-size income statement of **Maruti Suzuki**, we can see if its COGS as a percentage of revenue has been increasing or decreasing over time, and how it compares to competitors like **Tata Motors**.

### **Financial Ratios based on the Income Statement**

  * **Gross Profit Margin:** (Gross Profit / Revenue) x 100. This measures the profitability of a company's core business operations.
  * **Operating Profit Margin:** (Operating Profit / Revenue) x 100. This shows how much profit a company makes from its operations before interest and taxes.
  * **Net Profit Margin:** (Net Income / Revenue) x 100. This is the "bottom line" profitability, showing the percentage of revenue that is left after all expenses, including interest and taxes, have been deducted.

### **Implications for Financial Analysis & Exam Tips**

  * **Drill Down:** If a company's net profit margin is declining, a common-size income statement can help you pinpoint the reason. Is it due to a lower gross margin, higher operating expenses, or a higher tax rate?
  * **Exam Tip:** Be prepared to calculate and interpret common-size statements and the key profitability ratios. The exam will likely ask you to compare two companies or analyze a company's performance over time using these tools.
