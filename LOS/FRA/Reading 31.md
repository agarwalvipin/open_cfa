### **Reading 31: Analyzing Statements of Cash Flows II**

While Reading 30 was about constructing the statement, Reading 31 is about deconstructing it for analysis. Here, we move from "how it's made" to "what it means." This is where you, as an analyst, add real value by interpreting the numbers to assess a company's performance, flexibility, and value.

### **LOS a: analyze and interpret both reported and common-size cash flow statements.**

#### **Explanation**

Analyzing the cash flow statement involves evaluating the sources and uses of cash from the three core activities (operating, investing, and financing) to understand a company's financial health and strategic direction. 

* **Operating Cash Flow (CFO):** This is the lifeblood of a company. It shows the cash generated from the firm's primary business activities. A healthy, mature company should consistently generate strong, positive CFO.  A key analytical check is to compare CFO with net income. If net income is consistently higher than CFO, it could be a red flag for low-quality earnings, potentially due to aggressive revenue recognition or delayed expense recording. 
* **Investing Cash Flow (CFI):** This section reveals a company's investment strategy. Large cash outflows (uses of cash) typically indicate a company is investing in its future by buying property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) or acquiring other businesses.  Conversely, large cash inflows could mean the company is selling off assets, which might be to raise cash or exit unprofitable lines of business.
* **Financing Cash Flow (CFF):** This shows how a company raises capital and returns it to investors. Cash inflows come from issuing debt or equity. Cash outflows include repaying debt, repurchasing stock, and paying dividends.

**Common-Size Analysis of Cash Flows:**

Just like with the income statement and balance sheet, a common-size cash flow statement is a powerful tool. There are two main approaches:
1.  **Express each line item as a percentage of total revenue.** This shows how much cash is generated or used for every dollar of sales.
2.  **Express each inflow as a percentage of total cash inflows, and each outflow as a percentage of total cash outflows.** This shows the relative importance of each source and use of cash.

This standardization removes the effect of size, allowing for more meaningful comparisons over time and between different companies. 

#### **Real-World Examples**

* **Global Context (A Mature vs. Growth Company):**
    * **Coca-Cola (Mature):** You would expect to see strong and stable positive CFO. CFI would likely be negative but moderate, reflecting maintenance capital expenditures rather than massive expansion. CFF would likely be negative due to consistent dividend payments and stock buybacks.
    * **A fast-growing tech startup (Growth):** CFO might be negative as it builds working capital. CFI will almost certainly be heavily negative as it invests in technology and infrastructure. CFF will likely be strongly positive as it raises capital by issuing stock or taking on debt to fund its growth.
* **Indian Context (The Adani Group):** Many companies within the Adani Group are in a heavy investment phase, building ports, power plants, and airports. An analyst would expect to see very large negative CFI, financed by large positive CFF (issuing debt and equity). The key analytical question would be: when will these massive investments start generating substantial positive CFO to service the debt and reward shareholders? Comparing CFO to reported profits would be a crucial check on earnings quality.

#### **CFA Level 1 Exam Tips**

* **Understand Company Life Cycle and Cash Flows:** Be able to identify the typical cash flow profile of a company in different stages (startup, growth, mature, decline). This is a very common exam topic.
    * **Growth Stage:** Negative CFO, large negative CFI, large positive CFF. 
    * **Mature Stage:** Strong positive CFO, negative CFI (for maintenance), negative CFF (for dividends/buybacks).
* **CFO vs. Net Income:** This is a critical concept. Always be suspicious when a company reports high net income but low or negative CFO. It suggests the earnings are not backed by cash. 
* **Common-Size Interpretation:** Be prepared to look at a common-size cash flow statement and draw conclusions. For instance, if CFI as a percentage of revenue is consistently increasing, it signals a significant investment phase.

### **LOS b: calculate and interpret free cash flow to the firm, free cash flow to equity, and performance and coverage cash flow ratios.**

#### **Explanation**

This is the quantitative heart of cash flow analysis. These metrics are used extensively in valuation.

**Free Cash Flow (FCF):** This is the cash flow available to a company after it has paid for all its expenses and made the necessary investments in working capital and fixed assets to maintain and grow its operations. 

1.  **Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF):** This is the cash flow available to *all* capital providers (both debt and equity holders). It's calculated before interest payments.
2.  **Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE):** This is the cash flow available only to *equity* holders. It's calculated after interest payments and includes adjustments for net borrowing.

**Performance and Coverage Ratios:**

These ratios use cash flow data to provide a more robust picture of performance and safety than traditional ratios based on earnings.

* **Performance Ratios:** Measure the efficiency and profitability of the company from a cash perspective.
    * **Cash Flow-to-Revenue:** How much operating cash is generated per dollar of sales. 
    * **Cash Return-on-Assets/Equity:** How much operating cash is generated relative to the company's asset or equity base. 
* **Coverage Ratios:** Measure the company's ability to meet its debt and other obligations. These are critical for credit analysis.
    * **Debt Coverage Ratio:** How many times can operating cash flow cover total debt payments? 
    * **Interest Coverage Ratio:** How easily can the company pay its interest obligations from operating cash flow? 

#### **CFA Level 1 Exam Tips**

* **Memorize the FCF Formulas!** You absolutely must know how to calculate FCFF and FCFE. They are guaranteed to be on the exam.
* **Understand the "Why" behind the Formulas:**
    * Why add back after-tax interest to get FCFF? Because FCFF is cash available to *all* investors, and interest is the payment to debt investors. We add it back to CFO (which has interest deducted) to get to a pre-interest cash flow.
    * Why subtract fixed capital investment (FCInv)? Because this is the cash needed to maintain and grow the business; it's not "free" to be distributed to investors.
* **Ratio Interpretation is Key:** Don't just calculate the ratios; understand what they mean. A high Debt Coverage Ratio means the company is very safe from a creditor's perspective. A low Cash-to-Income ratio suggests poor earnings quality.

### **Summary of Formulas**

* **Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF):**
    * `FCFF = Net Income + Non-Cash Charges + Interest Expense × (1 – Tax Rate) – Fixed Capital Investment – Working Capital Investment` 
    * `FCFF = Cash Flow from Operations (CFO) + Interest Expense × (1 – Tax Rate) – Fixed Capital Investment` 

* **Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE):**
    * `FCFE = Cash Flow from Operations (CFO) – Fixed Capital Investment + Net Borrowing`
    * `FCFE = FCFF – Interest Expense × (1 – Tax Rate) + Net Borrowing` 

* **Performance Ratios:** 
    * **Cash Flow-to-Revenue:** `CFO / Net Revenue`
    * **Cash Return on Assets:** `CFO / Average Total Assets`
    * **Cash Return on Equity:** `CFO / Average Total Equity`
    * **Cash-to-Income:** `CFO / Operating Income`

* **Coverage Ratios:** 
    * **Debt Coverage:** `CFO / Total Debt`
    * **Interest Coverage:** `(CFO + Interest Paid + Taxes Paid) / Interest Paid`
    * **Reinvestment:** `CFO / Cash Paid for Long-Term Assets`
    * **Dividend Payment:** `CFO / Dividends Paid`

### **Quick Exam-Day Pointers**

1.  **FCF is a Valuation Input:** Remember that the whole point of calculating FCFF and FCFE is to use them in discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation models to determine a company's intrinsic value. This is a core concept throughout the CFA program.
2.  **Read the Footnotes:** For ratio calculations, especially coverage ratios, the cash flow statement itself might not have all the details. You may need to find "cash paid for interest" or "cash paid for taxes" in the footnotes.
3.  **Think Analytically:** When you see a cash flow statement question, don't just jump to the numbers. Ask yourself: What story is this statement telling me? Is the company growing? Is it profitable? Is it risky?
4.  **Practice, Practice, Practice:** The only way to get comfortable with these calculations and interpretations is to work through numerous practice problems.

Reading 31 is your first step into true financial analysis using cash flows. Master these concepts, and you'll have a powerful toolset for evaluating any company. Good luck!
