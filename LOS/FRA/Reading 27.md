### **Reading 27: Introduction to Financial Statement Analysis**

This reading is your entry point into the world of analyzing companies. Think of it as learning how to read a map before you set out on a journey. It tells you where to look for information, what to look out for, and how to structure your analysis.

#### **a. Describe the steps in the financial statement analysis framework.**

This LOS is about the structured process that analysts follow to ensure their analysis is thorough, logical, and repeatable. It's a six-step process.

**CFA Exam Tip:** The exam frequently tests the *order* of these steps. Memorize them and understand what each step entails.

**The 6-Step Framework:**

1.  **Articulate the Purpose and Context:**
    * **Explanation:** Before you even look at a single number, you must define the "why." Why are you doing this analysis? Are you trying to decide if you should buy stock in a company (equity analysis)? Are you a bank deciding whether to lend money (credit analysis)? Are you working on a potential merger? The purpose will determine the focus of your analysis.
    * **Indian Example:** An equity analyst at HDFC Securities is asked to issue a "buy" or "sell" recommendation for **Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)**. Their purpose is to determine TCS's intrinsic value and future stock price potential. A credit analyst at the State Bank of India (SBI), however, would analyze TCS's financial statements to assess its ability to repay a 500-crore loan. The equity analyst focuses on growth and profitability, while the credit analyst focuses on solvency and liquidity.

2.  **Collect Data:**
    * **Explanation:** Once you know your purpose, you gather your raw materials. This includes the company's financial statements (Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement), annual reports, regulatory filings, press releases, and industry data.
    * **Global Context:** For a US company like **Apple Inc.**, you would go to the SEC's EDGAR database. For an Indian company like **Infosys**, you'd use the SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) website, the companyâ€™s investor relations page, and stock exchange portals like the NSE (National Stock Exchange).

3.  **Process Data:**
    * **Explanation:** Raw data is messy. This step involves organizing it into a usable format. This could mean making adjustments to financial statements (e.g., for different accounting policies), calculating financial ratios, creating charts, or preparing common-size financial statements.
    * **Indian Example:** An analyst looking at **Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL)** might create a spreadsheet to track its revenue and profit margins for the last 10 years. They might also adjust the financials to see the performance of its different segments (like Retail, Jio, and Oil-to-Chemicals) separately.

4.  **Analyze/Interpret the Processed Data:**
    * **Explanation:** This is where the real analysis happens. You use the processed data to answer the question you defined in Step 1. What are the trends? How does the company compare to its competitors? What are its strengths and weaknesses?
    * **Indian Example:** By analyzing the processed data for **Maruti Suzuki**, an analyst might conclude: "Maruti's profit margins have declined over the last two years due to rising raw material costs, but their sales volume has grown faster than their main competitor, Hyundai, indicating strong market share."

5.  **Report the Conclusions and Recommendations:**
    * **Explanation:** Your analysis is only useful if it's communicated effectively. This step involves preparing a report or presentation that summarizes your findings and provides a clear recommendation (e.g., buy/sell/hold, approve loan). The report must be well-supported by the data and analysis.
    * **CFA Exam Tip:** A good analytical report is unbiased and objective. It clearly distinguishes between facts and opinions. This is a core part of the CFA Institute Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct.

6.  **Update the Analysis:**
    * **Explanation:** The world doesn't stand still. Companies release new information (like quarterly earnings), industry dynamics change, and economic conditions evolve. This step involves periodically reviewing and updating your analysis to ensure it remains relevant.
    * **Indian Example:** An analyst's "buy" rating on **Bajaj Finance** in January might need to be revisited in August after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announces a change in interest rates, which directly impacts the profitability of non-banking financial companies (NBFCs).

#### **b. Describe the roles of financial statement analysis.**

Financial statement analysis isn't just for one type of professional. It's a versatile skill used for various purposes.

* **Equity Analysis (Buy-side and Sell-side):** This is the most common role. Analysts use financial statements to value a company and make investment recommendations.
    * **Sell-side analysts** work for brokerage firms (like Motilal Oswal, Jefferies) and their reports are used to sell investment ideas to the public.
    * **Buy-side analysts** work for investment firms, mutual funds, and pension funds (like HDFC Mutual Fund, BlackRock) and they use the analysis to make investment decisions for their own portfolios.
* **Credit Analysis:** Lenders (banks, bondholders) use analysis to assess a borrower's ability to meet its debt obligations. They focus on solvency (ability to pay long-term debt) and liquidity (ability to pay short-term debt).
    * **Indian Example:** A credit rating agency like **CRISIL** or **ICRA** analyzes the financial health of a company like **Adani Enterprises** to assign a credit rating (e.g., AAA, AA+, B-) to its bonds. This rating signals the risk of default to potential investors.
* **Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A):** Analysts are crucial in determining the value of a target company and identifying potential synergies.
* **Corporate Finance:** Within a company, finance managers analyze their own firm's performance and compare it to competitors to identify areas for improvement and plan future strategy.
* **Regulation:** Regulatory bodies use financial statements to ensure companies are complying with rules and regulations.

#### **c. Describe the importance of regulatory filings, financial statement notes, management's commentary, and audit reports.**

The three main financial statements are just the tip of the iceberg. The real story is often in the surrounding documents.

**CFA Exam Tip:** This is a **highly testable** area. Know the purpose of each of these components, especially the auditor's report and the notes to financial statements.

* **Regulatory Filings (e.g., Annual/Quarterly Reports):**
    * **Importance:** These are the official, audited documents that companies are legally required to file. They provide the most comprehensive and reliable information.
    * **Global Context:** In the US, the main filings with the **SEC** are **Form 10-K (annual)** and **Form 10-Q (quarterly)**. In India, companies file similar reports with **SEBI** and the stock exchanges.

* **Financial Statement Notes (Footnotes):**
    * **Importance:** **This is one of the most critical parts of the annual report.** The notes provide details behind the numbers on the financial statements. They disclose the accounting policies used (e.g., LIFO vs. FIFO for inventory), details on debt, information about pending lawsuits, and breakdowns of major accounts.
    * **Indian Example:** The footnotes for a company like **Larsen & Toubro (L&T)** would provide a detailed breakdown of its long-term contracts, which is essential for understanding its revenue recognition methods and future profitability. **Never skip the footnotes!**

* **Management's Commentary (or Management's Discussion & Analysis - MD&A):**
    * **Importance:** This is the narrative part of the report where management tells their side of the story. They discuss the company's performance, key trends, future outlook, and risks.
    * **CFA Exam Tip:** Be critical when reading the MD&A. It is **unaudited** and can be biased. Management will naturally want to present the company in the best possible light. Look for a discussion that is candid about both positive and negative factors. A good MD&A provides insight into management's strategy and thinking.

* **Audit Reports:**
    * **Importance:** The audit report is an independent opinion on the fairness and reliability of the financial statements. It's provided by an external auditor (a Chartered Accountant firm).
    * **Key Audit Opinions:**
        * **Unqualified Opinion (or "Clean" Opinion):** This is the best outcome. It means the auditor found no material misstatements and the statements are presented fairly in accordance with the accounting standards.
        * **Qualified Opinion:** This is a "good, but..." opinion. The auditor is generally satisfied, but found a specific issue or a limitation of scope. This is a red flag for an analyst.
        * **Adverse Opinion:** This is the worst outcome. The auditor believes the financial statements are materially misstated and do not represent the company's true financial position. A huge red flag.
        * **Disclaimer of Opinion:** The auditor is unable to form an opinion, perhaps because they couldn't get enough evidence. Also a major red flag.
    * **Global Example:** The **Satyam Computer Services** scandal in India (2009) is a classic case. The company's financials were a complete fraud. The auditors (PricewaterhouseCoopers) initially gave clean opinions but later had to admit their failure to detect the fraud, highlighting the importance (and potential fallibility) of the audit process.

#### **d. Describe implications for financial analysis of alternative financial reporting systems and the importance of monitoring developments in financial reporting standards.**

Accounting is not a single global language; it has different dialects.

* **Alternative Financial Reporting Systems:**
    * **IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards):** Used by more than 140 countries, including the European Union, Australia, and Canada. India has adopted **Ind AS**, which is largely converged with IFRS. IFRS is considered more **principles-based**, meaning it provides general guidelines and requires more professional judgment.
    * **US GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles):** Used primarily by companies in the United States. It is considered more **rules-based**, providing very specific rules for how to account for transactions.
    * **Implications for Analysts:** You cannot directly compare a company using IFRS with a company using US GAAP without making adjustments. For example, the treatment of R&D costs or inventory valuation can be different, affecting reported profit and assets.
    * **CFA Exam Tip:** You don't need to be an expert on all the differences, but you **must** know that these differences exist and that IFRS is principles-based while US GAAP is rules-based.

* **Monitoring Developments:**
    * **Importance:** Accounting standards are always evolving. The bodies that set them (**IASB** for IFRS and **FASB** for US GAAP) constantly issue new standards. These changes can have a major impact on a company's reported financials.
    * **Example:** A few years ago, a new standard on lease accounting (IFRS 16) was introduced. It required companies to report most of their leases on the balance sheet as assets and liabilities. This significantly increased the reported assets and debt for many companies, especially in industries like retail and airlines, which lease a lot of property and equipment. An analyst who wasn't aware of this change would be very confused by the sudden jump in debt.

#### **e. Describe information sources that analysts use in financial statement analysis besides annual and interim financial reports.**

Analysts must look beyond the company's own reports to get a complete picture.

* **Company-Specific Information:**
    * **Press Releases:** Announcing major events like earnings, new contracts, or M&A deals.
    * **Conference Calls:** Management discusses quarterly results with analysts and investors. The Q&A section can be very revealing.
* **Industry and Economic Data:**
    * **Trade Publications & Industry Reports:** Provide context on industry trends, competition, and market size. For example, an analyst covering **Indian automobile companies** would read reports from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).
    * **Economic Data:** Government statistics on GDP growth, inflation (from the Ministry of Statistics), and interest rate announcements (from the **RBI**) provide a macroeconomic context for the company's performance.
* **Expert Networks & Primary Research:** Sometimes analysts will talk to industry experts, suppliers, or customers to get on-the-ground intelligence that isn't available in public documents.

### **Quick Exam-Day Pointers**

On exam day, if you see a question from this topic, remember to check for these key concepts:

1.  **The 6-Step Framework:** Know the steps in order (Purpose -> Collect -> Process -> Analyze -> Report -> Update).
2.  **MD&A is Unaudited:** Management's commentary is their perspective. It's useful but potentially biased. The financial statements are audited, but the MD&A is not.
3.  **Footnotes are Essential:** The notes to financial statements contain critical details. They are an integral part of the financial statements and are covered by the audit opinion.
4.  **Audit Opinions Matter:** Know the difference between unqualified (good), qualified (bad), adverse (very bad), and disclaimer of opinion (very bad). An unqualified opinion is the goal.
5.  **IFRS vs. US GAAP:** IFRS is principles-based, used globally. US GAAP is rules-based, used in the US. They are not directly comparable.
