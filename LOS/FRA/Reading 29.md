Of course! As a CFA charter holder and your teacher for this topic, I will provide a detailed, LOS-by-LOS explanation of Reading 29: Analyzing Balance Sheets. I will incorporate global and Indian examples, exam tips, and highlight crucial information to help you ace your CFA Level 1 exam.

### **Reading 29: Analyzing Balance Sheets**

This reading is fundamental. The balance sheet provides a snapshot of a company's financial health at a single point in time. For the exam, you'll need to know not just what's on the balance sheet, but also how to analyze the relationships between the items.

### **LOS a: explain the financial reporting and disclosures related to intangible assets.**

#### **Explanation**

**Intangible assets** are assets that are not physical in nature. They represent a company's legal or intellectual rights and competitive advantages. Think of them as valuable things you can't touch. There are two main categories:

1.  **Identifiable Intangibles:** These can be separated from the company and sold. Examples include:
    * **Patents:** Exclusive rights to an invention.
    * **Trademarks:** A symbol, word, or words legally registered or established by use as representing a company or product.
    * **Copyrights:** The exclusive legal right to print, publish, perform, film, or record literary, artistic, or musical material.
    * **Franchise Agreements:** A contract that allows a business to use the name and operating system of another business.

2.  **Unidentifiable Intangibles:** These cannot be separated from the company. The most common example is **goodwill**, which we will cover in the next LOS.

**Financial Reporting:**

* **Purchased Intangibles:** If a company buys an intangible asset from another party, it is recorded on the balance sheet at its fair value at the time of purchase.
* **Internally Developed Intangibles:** Most costs associated with developing intangible assets internally are expensed as they are incurred. For example, marketing costs to build a brand are expensed. **This is a key distinction and a common exam question!** The rationale is that it's difficult to determine the future economic benefits of these costs with certainty.

**Amortization and Impairment:**

* **Finite-Life Intangibles:** Intangible assets with a limited useful life (e.g., patents, copyrights) are **amortized** over their useful life. Amortization is similar to depreciation for tangible assets.
* **Indefinite-Life Intangibles:** Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life (e.g., trademarks) are not amortized. Instead, they are tested for **impairment** at least annually. Impairment occurs when the carrying value of the asset on the balance sheet is greater than its recoverable amount.

#### **Real-World Examples**

* **Global Context (Apple Inc.):** Apple's brand is one of the most valuable in the world. However, you won't see the full value of the Apple brand on its balance sheet because it was developed internally. The costs associated with creating that brand (marketing, advertising) were expensed as they were incurred. What you *will* see are the patents for their technology, which are identifiable intangible assets.
* **Indian Context (Dr. Reddy's Laboratories):** As a pharmaceutical company, Dr. Reddy's holds numerous patents for its drugs. These patents are valuable intangible assets that give the company the exclusive right to produce and sell those drugs for a certain period. When Dr. Reddy's acquires a patent from another company, it will be recorded on its balance sheet.

#### **CFA Level 1 Exam Tips**

* **Focus on the distinction between purchased and internally developed intangibles.** The exam loves to test this. Remember: purchased intangibles are capitalized; internally developed intangibles are expensed (with some exceptions under IFRS for development costs).
* **Know the difference between amortization and impairment.** Finite-life intangibles are amortized and tested for impairment. Indefinite-life intangibles are *not* amortized but are tested for impairment.
* **Pay attention to the footnotes.** The disclosures in the financial statements will provide details about the company's intangible assets, their useful lives, and the amortization methods used.

**\*\*IMPORTANT\*\***: The treatment of research and development (R&D) costs is a classic exam topic. Under US GAAP, both research and development costs are expensed. Under IFRS, research costs are expensed, but development costs may be capitalized if certain criteria are met. This is a frequently tested difference between IFRS and US GAAP.

### **LOS b: explain the financial reporting and disclosures related to goodwill.**

#### **Explanation**

**Goodwill** is an unidentifiable intangible asset that arises when one company acquires another for a price greater than the fair value of its net identifiable assets (identifiable assets minus liabilities). It represents the non-physical assets that are not individually identifiable, such as a strong brand reputation, a loyal customer base, and good employee relations.

**Creation of Goodwill:**

Goodwill is *only* created in an acquisition. It is calculated as:

> **Goodwill = Purchase Price - Fair Value of Net Identifiable Assets**

**Financial Reporting:**

* Goodwill is recorded as an asset on the acquirer's balance sheet.
* Goodwill is considered to have an **indefinite life** and is therefore **not amortized**.
* It must be tested for **impairment** at least annually. If the carrying value of the reporting unit (the part of the company that contains the goodwill) exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss must be recognized.

#### **Real-World Examples**

* **Global Context (Microsoft's acquisition of LinkedIn):** In 2016, Microsoft acquired LinkedIn for approximately $26.2 billion. A significant portion of this purchase price was allocated to goodwill. This goodwill represented the value of LinkedIn's professional network, its brand reputation, and its user data – things that were not listed as individual assets on LinkedIn's balance sheet.
* **Indian Context (Tata Steel's acquisition of Corus):** In 2007, Tata Steel acquired the Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus. The purchase price was significantly higher than the fair value of Corus's tangible assets. The difference was recorded as goodwill on Tata Steel's balance sheet, representing Corus's established position in the European market, its customer relationships, and its skilled workforce.

#### **CFA Level 1 Exam Tips**

* **Remember that goodwill is only created during an acquisition.** A company cannot create goodwill on its own.
* **Know how to calculate goodwill.** It's a simple formula, but you need to be sure you're using the *fair value* of the net identifiable assets, not the book value.
* **Goodwill is not amortized.** This is a key point. It is tested for impairment.
* **An impairment of goodwill can be a red flag.** It suggests that the acquiring company overpaid for the acquisition or that the acquired company's performance has declined.

**\*\*IMPORTANT\*\***: Be able to distinguish goodwill from other intangible assets. Goodwill is a residual amount and is unidentifiable. Other intangibles, like patents, are identifiable.

### **LOS c: explain the financial reporting and disclosures related to financial instruments.**

#### **Explanation**

A **financial instrument** is a contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. In simpler terms, they are assets that you can trade.

**Financial Assets:**

These are assets like:

* **Cash and cash equivalents**
* **Marketable securities:** Stocks and bonds of other companies.
* **Receivables:** Money owed to the company by its customers.

**Classification of Financial Assets:**

This is a complex area, but for Level 1, you need to understand the basic classifications:

1.  **Amortized Cost:** The asset is recorded at its cost, and interest income is recognized over time.
2.  **Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI):** Changes in the fair value of the asset are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI), which is a separate section of the income statement.
3.  **Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL):** Changes in the fair value of the asset are recorded directly on the income statement.

**Financial Liabilities:**

These are obligations to pay another entity, such as:

* **Accounts payable:** Money the company owes to its suppliers.
* **Notes payable and bonds payable:** Money the company has borrowed.

**Disclosures:**

Companies must provide detailed disclosures about their financial instruments, including:

* Their carrying values and fair values.
* The risks associated with them (e.g., credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk).

#### **Real-World Examples**

* **Global Context (JPMorgan Chase):** As a major bank, JPMorgan Chase's balance sheet is dominated by financial instruments. On the asset side, it has loans to customers, investments in government and corporate bonds, and trading securities. On the liability side, it has customer deposits and debt it has issued.
* **Indian Context (HDFC Bank):** HDFC Bank's balance sheet is similar. It has a large portfolio of loans to individuals and businesses (financial assets) and has taken in deposits from customers (financial liabilities). It also invests in government securities (G-Secs) and corporate bonds.

#### **CFA Level 1 Exam Tips**

* **Understand the definitions of financial assets and financial liabilities.**
* **Focus on the different classifications of financial assets and how they affect the financial statements.** The key is to know where the changes in fair value are reported (income statement vs. OCI).
* **Read the questions carefully.** They will often specify the classification of the financial instrument.
* **Don't get bogged down in the details.** Level 1 tests the high-level concepts. You don't need to be an expert on the intricacies of financial instrument accounting.

**\*\*IMPORTANT\*\***: The classification of financial assets determines how they are valued and how changes in value are reported. This has a direct impact on a company's reported earnings and its financial ratios.

### **LOS d: explain the financial reporting and disclosures related to non-current liabilities.**

#### **Explanation**

**Non-current liabilities** (or long-term liabilities) are obligations that are due more than one year from the balance sheet date. They represent a company's long-term financing. Common examples include:

* **Bonds Payable:** A form of long-term debt where the company issues bonds to investors.
* **Long-Term Notes Payable:** Similar to bonds but often issued to a single lender, like a bank.
* **Lease Liabilities:** The obligation to make payments on a lease.
* **Deferred Tax Liabilities:** The amount of income tax payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences.

**Financial Reporting:**

* Non-current liabilities are typically reported at their **present value**, which is the discounted value of their future cash flows.
* The disclosures in the footnotes are crucial. They provide information on:
    * The interest rates on the debt.
    * The maturity dates.
    * Any covenants (restrictions placed on the borrower).

#### **Real-World Examples**

* **Global Context (AT&T):** A telecommunications giant like AT&T requires massive infrastructure investments. It finances these investments by issuing a large amount of long-term debt (bonds). You will find billions of dollars in non-current liabilities on its balance sheet.
* **Indian Context (Reliance Industries Ltd.):** Reliance has undertaken huge capital-intensive projects, such as the Jamnagar refinery and the Jio network. To fund these, it has raised significant amounts of long-term debt from both domestic and international markets.

#### **CFA Level 1 Exam Tips**

* **Understand the different types of non-current liabilities.** Be able to identify them on a balance sheet.
* **Focus on bond terminology.** Know what par value, coupon rate, and maturity date mean.
* **Pay attention to covenants.** A violation of a debt covenant can be a serious issue for a company and may lead to the debt becoming due immediately.
* **Deferred tax liabilities can be tricky.** For Level 1, have a basic understanding of what they are and why they arise (differences between accounting income and taxable income).

**\*\*IMPORTANT\*\***: A company's mix of long-term debt and equity is its capital structure. Analyzing the non-current liabilities is key to understanding a company's leverage and its financial risk.

### **LOS e: calculate and interpret common-size balance sheets and related financial ratios.**

#### **Explanation**

**Common-size analysis** is a technique used to standardize financial statements, allowing for easier comparison across time and between companies of different sizes.

* **Common-Size Balance Sheet:** Each item on the balance sheet is expressed as a percentage of **total assets**. This helps to see the composition of assets, liabilities, and equity. For example, you can see what percentage of a company's assets are financed by debt versus equity.

**Financial Ratios:**

Balance sheet ratios help to assess a company's liquidity, solvency, and overall financial health. Key ratios include:

* **Liquidity Ratios:** Measure a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations.
    * **Current Ratio:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities
    * **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):** (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
* **Solvency Ratios:** Measure a company's ability to meet its long-term obligations.
    * **Debt-to-Assets Ratio:** Total Debt / Total Assets
    * **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** Total Debt / Total Equity

#### **Real-World Examples**

* **Global Context (Comparing Walmart and Target):** If you just look at the dollar values on their balance sheets, it's hard to compare Walmart and Target because Walmart is much larger. But if you create common-size balance sheets, you can see, for example, what percentage of each company's assets is tied up in inventory. This allows for a more meaningful comparison of their inventory management efficiency.
* **Indian Context (Comparing Infosys and TCS):** Both are major IT companies in India. A common-size balance sheet would allow you to compare their capital structures. For example, you could see what percentage of their assets is financed by debt, which can be an indicator of their risk appetite.

#### **CFA Level 1 Exam Tips**

* **You must know how to calculate and interpret the key ratios.** Memorize the formulas!
* **Understand what each ratio tells you.** Don't just calculate the number; be able to explain what it means about the company's financial health.
* **Common-size analysis is a powerful tool.** Be prepared to see a common-size balance sheet on the exam and be asked to draw conclusions from it.
* **Look for trends.** When you are given multiple years of data, calculate the ratios for each year and see how they are changing over time.

**\*\*IMPORTANT\*\***: Ratios are most useful when they are compared to something else – either the company's own historical ratios or the ratios of its competitors (industry analysis).

### **Summary of Formulas**

* **Goodwill:** Purchase Price - Fair Value of Net Identifiable Assets
* **Current Ratio:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities
* **Quick Ratio:** (Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities OR (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
* **Debt-to-Assets Ratio:** Total Debt / Total Assets
* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** Total Debt / Total Shareholders' Equity
* **Total Debt:** Total of interest-bearing short-term and long-term debt (check the vignette for specifics)
