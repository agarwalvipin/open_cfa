### **Reading 30: Analyzing Statements of Cash Flows I**

The Statement of Cash Flows is arguably one of the most critical financial statements for an analyst. While the income statement can be influenced by accounting choices and estimates, the cash flow statement shows the real cash moving in and out of a company. It bridges the gap between the accrual-based income statement and the cash-based reality of a business.

---

### [cite_start]**LOS a: describe how the cash flow statement is linked to the income statement and the balance sheet.** [cite: 36]

#### **Explanation**

The three main financial statements are intrinsically linked. Think of it this way:

* The **Income Statement** shows performance over a period (e.g., a year).
* The **Balance Sheet** shows financial position at a single point in time (the beginning and end of that period).
* [cite_start]The **Statement of Cash Flows** explains the change in the cash balance on the balance sheet from the beginning to the end of the period, by categorizing cash flows into operating, investing, and financing activities. [cite: 214]

The fundamental link is the following equation:

> **Beginning Cash + Cash from Operations (CFO) + Cash from Investing (CFI) + Cash from Financing (CFF) = Ending Cash**

Here's how they connect:

* [cite_start]**Income Statement & CFO:** Net income is the starting point for the indirect method of calculating Cash Flow from Operations (CFO). [cite: 218] [cite_start]We then make adjustments for non-cash items (like depreciation) and changes in working capital (like accounts receivable and payable) to arrive at CFO. [cite: 213, 220]
* **Balance Sheet & Cash Flow Statement:**
    * [cite_start]**Operating Activities (CFO)** are generally linked to changes in current assets and current liabilities (e.g., inventory, accounts receivable, accounts payable). [cite: 220, 244]
    * [cite_start]**Investing Activities (CFI)** are typically related to changes in non-current assets (e.g., buying or selling property, plant, and equipment). [cite: 221, 244]
    * [cite_start]**Financing Activities (CFF)** are usually connected to changes in non-current liabilities and equity (e.g., issuing bonds, repurchasing stock, paying dividends). [cite: 221, 245]

#### **Real-World Examples**

* **Global Context (Amazon):** Amazon might report a huge net income. However, to understand its true cash-generating ability, you must look at its CFO. Amazon heavily invests in new warehouses and technology (a use of cash in CFI). It finances these investments by issuing debt or stock (a source of cash in CFF). The cash flow statement shows how these three activities interact to result in the change in Amazon's cash balance for the year.
* **Indian Context (Larsen & Toubro):** L&T is a major engineering and construction company. It might win a large contract and recognize revenue over several years (Income Statement). The cash from this project, however, might be received in a different pattern. The cash flow statement is essential to see if L&T is collecting cash from its customers faster or slower than it's recognizing revenue. This is crucial for managing its working capital.

#### **CFA Level 1 Exam Tips**

* **Master the linkages!** You will almost certainly get questions that require you to understand how an event affects all three statements.
* For example, if a company buys equipment with cash:
    * **Balance Sheet:** Cash goes down, PP&E goes up.
    * **Cash Flow Statement:** It's a use of cash in Investing Activities (CFI).
    * **Income Statement:** No immediate impact, but depreciation will be an expense in future periods.
* Remember that Net Income does **not** equal Cash Flow from Operations. The difference is accruals. [cite_start]High-quality earnings are backed by strong cash flow. [cite: 215, 216]

### [cite_start]**LOS b: describe the steps in the preparation of direct and indirect cash flow statements, including how cash flows can be computed using income statement and balance sheet data.** [cite: 37]

#### **Explanation**

The only difference between the direct and indirect methods is in the presentation of **Cash Flow from Operations (CFO)**. [cite_start]CFI and CFF are presented identically under both methods. [cite: 225]

1.  **Indirect Method (Most Common):**
    * **Starts with Net Income.**
    * **Adjusts for non-cash charges:** Add back expenses that don't use cash (like depreciation and amortization) and subtract revenues that don't generate cash.
    * **Adjusts for changes in working capital:**
        * Increases in operating assets (like accounts receivable) are a use of cash (subtracted).
        * Decreases in operating assets are a source of cash (added).
        * Increases in operating liabilities (like accounts payable) are a source of cash (added).
        * Decreases in operating liabilities are a use of cash (subtracted).

2.  **Direct Method (Preferred by CFA Institute and standard-setters, but less common in practice):**
    * **Shows actual cash inflows and outflows.** It's like a cash-basis income statement.
    * Major classes of gross cash receipts and payments are disclosed, such as:
        * Cash collected from customers
        * Cash paid to suppliers
        * Cash paid to employees
        * Interest paid
        * Taxes paid
    * Each of these line items is calculated by taking the income statement line item and adjusting it for changes in the related balance sheet accounts.

#### **Real-World Examples**

* **Global Context (Microsoft):** Most large companies, like Microsoft, use the indirect method because it's easier to prepare and it provides a useful reconciliation of net income to cash flow. An analyst can quickly see the major non-cash items and working capital changes that explain the difference between reported profit and cash generated.
* **Indian Context (Reliance Industries):** If you look at Reliance's annual report, you'll likely find the cash flow statement prepared using the indirect method. This is standard practice in India as well. While the direct method provides more detail on the sources and uses of cash, the indirect method is permitted and widely used.

#### **CFA Level 1 Exam Tips**

* **You must be able to convert from the indirect method to the direct method (and vice-versa), at least conceptually.**
* **Memorize the rules for the indirect method.** You will be tested on this. Remember: "Assets and cash move in opposite directions, liabilities and cash move in the same direction."
* **Direct Method Calculations:**
    * **Cash Collected from Customers** = Sales - Increase in Accounts Receivable
    * **Cash Paid to Suppliers** = Cost of Goods Sold + Increase in Inventory - Increase in Accounts Payable
* [cite_start]**The final CFO figure is the same under both methods.** This is a critical check figure. [cite: 225]

### [cite_start]**LOS c: demonstrate the conversion of cash flows from the indirect to direct method.** [cite: 38, 224]

#### **Explanation**

To convert the CFO section from the indirect method to the direct method, you essentially need to reverse the indirect method's adjustments to net income and then reconstruct the cash inflows and outflows.

**The process generally involves:**

1.  **Start with the components of Net Income:** Sales, COGS, SG&A expense, etc.
2.  **Adjust each income statement line item** for the changes in the related balance sheet accounts (the working capital adjustments from the indirect method).
    * For example, to find **Cash Collected from Customers**, you take `Sales Revenue` and adjust it for the `Change in Accounts Receivable`.
    * To find **Cash Paid to Suppliers**, you start with `Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)` and adjust it for the `Change in Inventory` and the `Change in Accounts Payable`.
3.  **Non-cash charges** like depreciation, which were added back in the indirect method, are ignored in the direct method calculations (because they aren't cash flows).

#### **CFA Level 1 Exam Tips**

* This is a mechanical skill that is highly testable. Practice the conversion with problems.
* The exam will give you an income statement and beginning and ending balance sheets (or just the changes in the accounts) and ask you to calculate a specific cash flow, like "cash paid for interest."
* **Key Formula:** Cash Paid for Interest = Interest Expense - Increase in Interest Payable (or + Decrease in Interest Payable).
* **Key Formula:** Cash Paid for Taxes = Income Tax Expense - Increase in Taxes Payable + Increase in Deferred Tax Liability (or - Increase in Deferred Tax Asset).

### [cite_start]**LOS d: contrast cash flow statements prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and US generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP).** [cite: 39, 232]

#### **Explanation**

This is a major topic for Level 1. While largely similar, there are key differences in how certain items can be classified.

| Cash Flow Item      | **US GAAP Classification** | **IFRS Classification** |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Interest Paid** | Operating (CFO)                                              | Operating (CFO) or Financing (CFF)                              |
| **Interest Received** | Operating (CFO)                                              | Operating (CFO) or Investing (CFI)                              |
| **Dividends Paid** | Financing (CFF)                                              | Operating (CFO) or Financing (CFF)                              |
| **Dividends Received**| Operating (CFO)                                              | Operating (CFO) or Investing (CFI)                              |
| **Taxes Paid** | Operating (CFO) (Always)                                     | Operating (CFO), unless can be specifically identified with a CFI or CFF transaction. |

**The Big Picture:** IFRS provides more flexibility, allowing companies to classify these items based on the nature of their business. [cite_start]US GAAP is more rigid. [cite: 235]

#### **Real-World Examples**

* **Global Context:** A European manufacturing company (reporting under IFRS) might classify interest paid on its factory construction loan as a financing outflow (CFF), arguing it's a cost of financing. [cite_start]An identical US company (under US GAAP) *must* classify that same interest payment as an operating outflow (CFO). [cite: 233] This can make direct comparison of CFO between the two companies misleading without adjustment.
* **Indian Context (Ind-AS):** Indian Accounting Standards (Ind-AS) are largely converged with IFRS. Therefore, Indian companies have the same flexibility as IFRS-reporting companies regarding the classification of interest and dividends. This is an important distinction from US companies.

#### **CFA Level 1 Exam Tips**

* **Memorize the table above!** This is a very frequent source of exam questions.
* **The most important takeaway:** Because of these classification differences, an analyst must read the footnotes and potentially reclassify items to make a valid comparison between a US GAAP company and an IFRS company.
* For example, to compare CFO, an analyst might move interest paid from CFF to CFO for an IFRS firm to make it comparable to a US GAAP firm.

### **Summary of Formulas (Conceptual)**

* **CFO (Indirect Method):** Net Income + Non-Cash Charges - Working Capital Investment
* **CFO (Direct Method):** Cash from Customers - Cash Paid to Suppliers/Employees - Cash Paid for Interest/Taxes
* **Cash Collected from Customers:** Sales ± Change in Accounts Receivable
* **Cash Paid to Suppliers:** COGS ± Change in Inventory ± Change in Accounts Payable

### **Quick Exam-Day Pointers**

1.  **GAAP vs. IFRS is Key:** Always check whether the question specifies US GAAP or IFRS. This will determine how you treat interest, dividends, and taxes.
2.  **Indirect Method Rules:** Remember the source/use of cash rules for assets and liabilities. Write them down on your scratch paper if it helps.
3.  **Watch out for Non-Cash Transactions:** A company might acquire an asset by issuing stock. This is a significant investing and financing activity, but it has no cash impact and will be disclosed in the footnotes, not in the main body of the cash flow statement.
4.  **CFO is King:** For analytical purposes, CFO is the most important section. A healthy company must generate positive cash flow from its core business operations over the long term.
5.  **Reconciliation is Your Check:** If you calculate all three sections (CFO, CFI, CFF), the sum should equal the change in the cash balance on the balance sheet. This is a great way to check your work if the problem provides enough information.

This reading is all about understanding the mechanics and the analytical implications. Practice problems are the best way to master it. Let me know if you'd like to dive into any of these areas in more detail!
