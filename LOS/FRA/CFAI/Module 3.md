### **Reading 3: Analyzing Balance Sheets**

The balance sheet provides a snapshot of a company's financial position—what it owns (Assets) and what it owes (Liabilities), and the owners' residual claim (Equity)—at a single point in time. It is governed by the fundamental accounting equation: **Assets = Liabilities + Equity**.

#### **1. Intangible Assets and Goodwill**

**Detailed Explanation:**
* **Intangible Assets:** These are non-monetary assets without physical substance.
    * **Identifiable Intangibles:** These can be separated from the company and sold, like patents, trademarks, copyrights, and licenses.
        * **Purchased Intangibles:** Recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value (usually the purchase cost).
        * **Internally Developed Intangibles:**
            * **IFRS:** Distinguishes between a research phase and a development phase. **Research costs must be expensed**. **Development costs can be capitalized** as an asset if certain criteria are met (e.g., technical feasibility).
            * **U.S. GAAP:** Generally requires **both research and development costs to be expensed**, with a key exception for software development costs after technological feasibility is established.
    * **Goodwill:** This is an unidentifiable intangible asset. It arises only during a business acquisition. It is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets (Assets - Liabilities) acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually. An impairment charge reduces earnings.

**Indian Context Example:**
When **Walmart acquired a majority stake in Flipkart**, it paid a price significantly higher than the fair value of Flipkart's identifiable assets (like warehouses, servers, and its brand name). This excess amount was recorded on Walmart's consolidated balance sheet as **goodwill**. This goodwill represents intangible factors like Flipkart's customer base, established supply chain, and market position.

> **CFA Exam Tip:**
> The different treatments of R&D costs under IFRS and U.S. GAAP are a key testable point. Remember: **IFRS allows capitalization of development costs; U.S. GAAP generally does not (except for software)**. Also, know that **goodwill is not amortized** but is tested for impairment. A goodwill impairment charge is a non-cash expense that reduces net income.

#### **2. Financial Instruments**

**Detailed Explanation:**
A financial instrument is a contract that gives rise to a financial asset for one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument for another. On the balance sheet, a company's investments in the stocks or bonds of other companies are financial assets.

They are measured in one of two ways:
1.  **Amortized Cost:** Used for debt securities (like bonds) that the company has both the ability and intent to hold until maturity. The asset is reported at its cost, adjusted for any premium or discount amortization. Unrealized gains and losses are ignored.
2.  **Fair Value:** Used for most other investments. The asset is reported at its current market value. The treatment of unrealized gains and losses depends on the classification:
    * **Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL):** Unrealized gains and losses are reported on the income statement. This is used for trading securities.
    * **Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI):** Unrealized gains and losses bypass the income statement and are reported in "Other Comprehensive Income," which is a component of equity. This is used for securities classified as "Available-for-Sale."

**Indian Context Example:**
**HDFC Bank** holds a large portfolio of government bonds.
* Bonds it intends to hold until they mature would be classified as **Held-to-Maturity** and measured at **amortized cost**.
* A portfolio of bonds and stocks it actively trades to make short-term profits would be classified as **Trading Securities** and measured at **Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL)**.
* A strategic investment in another company's bonds that it may sell before maturity but doesn't actively trade would be classified as **Available-for-Sale** and measured at **Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI)**.

> **CFA Exam Tip:**
> For the exam, you need to know the three main classifications for financial assets (Amortized Cost/Held-to-Maturity, FVTPL/Trading, FVOCI/Available-for-Sale) and, crucially, **where the unrealized gains and losses are reported for each**. This is a common exam topic.

#### **3. Non-Current Liabilities**

**Detailed Explanation:**
These are obligations that are not due within one year or the company's operating cycle. Key examples include:

* **Bonds Payable and Long-Term Notes Payable:** These are typically reported at amortized cost. The carrying amount will be the face value adjusted for any unamortized premium or discount.
* **Deferred Tax Liabilities:** These arise from temporary differences between accounting profit and taxable income. Specifically, a deferred tax liability is created when a company reports lower taxable income (and thus pays less tax) now than its accounting income before tax. The most common cause is using accelerated depreciation for tax purposes while using straight-line depreciation for financial reporting. This creates a liability for the taxes that are expected to be paid in the future when the temporary difference reverses.

**Indian Context Example:**
**Larsen & Toubro (L&T)** issues a 10-year bond to fund a new infrastructure project. This bond is a **non-current liability** on its balance sheet. If L&T uses an accelerated depreciation method for tax purposes on its construction equipment but straight-line for its annual report, it will create a **deferred tax liability**.

> **CFA Exam Tip:**
> Understand the origin of deferred tax liabilities. The classic example is the difference in depreciation methods between tax and financial reporting. Remember that a **deferred tax liability represents taxes that are expected to be paid in the future**.

#### **4. Common-Size Balance Sheets and Ratios**

**Detailed Explanation:**
* **Common-Size Balance Sheet:** A vertical common-size balance sheet expresses each item as a percentage of **total assets**. This is extremely useful for comparing companies of different sizes or for analyzing changes in a single company's structure over time. For example, it allows you to see if inventory is becoming a larger or smaller percentage of the company's total assets.
* **Balance Sheet Ratios:** These ratios help assess a company's liquidity and solvency.
    * **Liquidity Ratios:** Measure the ability to meet short-term obligations.
        * **Current Ratio**
        * **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)**
    * **Solvency Ratios:** Measure the ability to meet long-term obligations. These often focus on financial leverage.
        * **Debt-to-Assets Ratio**
        * **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**
        * **Financial Leverage Ratio**

**Indian Context Example:**
An analyst could create a common-size balance sheet for **Maruti Suzuki** and **Tata Motors**. By expressing all items as a percentage of total assets, the analyst could directly compare their capital structures. For instance, they might find that Tata Motors has a higher percentage of its assets financed by debt compared to Maruti Suzuki, indicating higher financial risk.

> **CFA Exam Tip:**
> Be comfortable calculating and interpreting the key liquidity and solvency ratios. A question might provide balance sheet data and ask you to calculate the current ratio or the debt-to-equity ratio. Also, understand what a common-size balance sheet shows – it standardizes the balance sheet by **total assets**, making comparisons easier.

### **Reading 3: Summary**

#### **List of Formulas Used**
1.  **Current Ratio:**
    $$\text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}$$

2.  **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):**
    $$\text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cash} + \text{Marketable Securities} + \text{Receivables}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}$$

3.  **Debt-to-Assets Ratio:**
    $$\text{Debt-to-Assets Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Total Assets}}$$

4.  **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:**
    $$\text{Debt-to-Equity Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Total Equity}}$$

5.  **Financial Leverage Ratio:**
    $$\text{Financial Leverage} = \frac{\text{Total Assets}}{\text{Total Equity}}$$

#### **Quick Exam-Day Pointer**
* **IFRS vs. U.S. GAAP for R&D:** IFRS allows capitalizing **development** costs; U.S. GAAP generally expenses both.
* **Goodwill** is created in an acquisition and is **not amortized**.
* Know the three classifications for **financial assets** and where their **unrealized gains/losses** are reported.
* A **deferred tax liability** often arises from using accelerated depreciation for tax and straight-line for reporting.
* A **common-size balance sheet** expresses all items as a % of **total assets**.
