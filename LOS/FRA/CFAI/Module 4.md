### **Reading 4: Analyzing Statements of Cash Flows I**

This reading focuses on understanding the structure of the Statement of Cash Flows (SCF), its linkages with other statements, and the two methods for presenting cash flow from operations. The SCF is critical because it shows where a company's cash is coming from and where it is going.

#### **1. Linkages Between the Financial Statements**

**Detailed Explanation:**
The financial statements are not standalone documents; they are intricately linked. The Statement of Cash Flows acts as a bridge for the cash account between two balance sheets.

* **Beginning Cash (from last year's Balance Sheet) +/- Cash from Operations +/- Cash from Investing +/- Cash from Financing = Ending Cash (on this year's Balance Sheet).**
* **Link to Income Statement:** Net income is the starting point for the indirect method of calculating Cash Flow from Operations (CFO). Non-cash charges like depreciation and amortization are added back to net income.
* **Link to Balance Sheet:** Changes in working capital accounts (like accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable) are used to adjust net income to arrive at CFO. The purchase or sale of long-term assets (an investing activity) changes the PP&E balance. Issuing debt or equity (a financing activity) changes the liabilities and equity balances.

**Indian Context Example:**
If **Asian Paints** reports a net income of ₹3,000 crore on its income statement, this ₹3,000 crore will be the first line item in the operating activities section of its SCF (if using the indirect method). They will then add back depreciation on their paint factories. If their inventory increased during the year, that increase will be a subtraction in the CFO calculation. The final "Ending Cash" figure on the SCF will be the "Cash and Cash Equivalents" amount shown on their year-end balance sheet.

> **CFA Exam Tip:**
> Understanding the linkages is crucial. A common question might ask how a transaction affects all three financial statements. For example, "How does the purchase of equipment with cash affect the financial statements?" Answer: On the SCF, it's a cash outflow from investing (CFI). On the balance sheet, cash decreases and PP&E increases by the same amount. There is no immediate impact on the income statement (until depreciation begins).

#### **2. Direct and Indirect Methods for Cash Flow from Operations (CFO)**

**Detailed Explanation:**
There are two ways to present the operating activities section of the SCF. **Importantly, the net result (total CFO) is the same under both methods.** The investing and financing sections are always presented using the direct method format.

1.  **Indirect Method:**
    * This is the most common method used by companies.
    * It starts with **Net Income** and reconciles it to net cash from operating activities.
    * **Adjustments:**
        * **Add back non-cash charges:** Depreciation, amortization, impairment losses.
        * **Subtract non-cash gains:** Gains on sale of assets.
        * **Adjust for changes in working capital:**
            * Increase in an operating asset (e.g., Accounts Receivable, Inventory) is a use of cash -> **Subtract**.
            * Decrease in an operating asset is a source of cash -> **Add**.
            * Increase in an operating liability (e.g., Accounts Payable) is a source of cash -> **Add**.
            * Decrease in an operating liability is a use of cash -> **Subtract**.

2.  **Direct Method:**
    * This method shows the actual cash inflows and outflows, such as "Cash received from customers" and "Cash paid to suppliers."
    * It provides more detail about the sources and uses of operating cash.
    * Companies that use the direct method are still required to provide a reconciliation of net income to CFO (the indirect method) in the notes.

**Converting from Indirect to Direct:**
Analysts can convert an indirect statement to a direct one by using income statement and balance sheet data to calculate the major cash flow components:
* **Cash Received from Customers** = Revenue - Increase in Accounts Receivable
* **Cash Paid to Suppliers** = COGS + Increase in Inventory - Increase in Accounts Payable

**Indian Context Example:**
Almost all Indian companies, like **Hindustan Unilever (HUL)**, use the **indirect method** for their SCF. An analyst could take HUL's income statement and balance sheets to approximate its direct method cash flows. For instance, they would take HUL's revenue for the year and subtract the year-over-year increase in its trade receivables to estimate the actual cash collected from its distributors and retailers.

> **CFA Exam Tip:**
> You must be proficient with the **indirect method**. The exam will provide a small income statement and changes in balance sheet accounts and ask you to calculate CFO. Remember the rules for adjusting for changes in working capital assets and liabilities. Also, knowing how to perform a simple conversion from indirect to direct (e.g., calculating Cash Received from Customers) is a valuable skill.

#### **3. Differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS for the SCF**

**Detailed Explanation:**
IFRS provides more flexibility than U.S. GAAP in classifying certain cash flows.

| Cash Flow Item | U.S. GAAP Classification | IFRS Classification (Choice) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Interest Received** | **Operating (CFO)** | Operating (CFO) or Investing (CFI) |
| **Dividends Received**| **Operating (CFO)** | Operating (CFO) or Investing (CFI) |
| **Interest Paid** | **Operating (CFO)** | Operating (CFO) or Financing (CFF) |
| **Dividends Paid** | **Financing (CFF)** | Operating (CFO) or Financing (CFF) |
| **Taxes Paid** | **Operating (CFO)** | Generally CFO, but can be split if related to investing/financing |

**Indian Context Example:**
Since Ind AS is based on IFRS, an Indian company like **ITC** has choices. It could classify the interest paid on its corporate bonds as either a cash outflow from operations (CFO) or from financing (CFF). A U.S.-based competitor like **Philip Morris International** must classify interest paid as CFO. This flexibility can make direct comparison of the reported CFO between the two companies difficult without adjustment.

> **CFA Exam Tip:**
> This table is **extremely important and frequently tested**. The exam loves to ask questions about the classification of interest and dividends under the two standards. Memorize these differences.

### **Reading 4: Summary**

#### **List of Formulas Used**
*No new major formulas, but the following computational frameworks are key:*

1.  **Indirect Method CFO Calculation:**
    * Start with Net Income
    * \+ Non-cash charges (e.g., Depreciation)
    * \- Non-cash gains (e.g., Gain on sale of asset)
    * \- Increase in Operating Assets (e.g., A/R, Inventory)
    * \+ Decrease in Operating Assets
    * \+ Increase in Operating Liabilities (e.g., A/P)
    * \- Decrease in Operating Liabilities
    * = Cash Flow from Operations (CFO)

2.  **Simple Direct Method Conversions:**
    * **Cash Received from Customers** = Sales Revenue − ΔAccounts Receivable
    * **Cash Paid to Suppliers** = COGS + ΔInventory − ΔAccounts Payable

#### **Quick Exam-Day Pointer**
* The SCF links the beginning and ending cash balances on the balance sheet.
* Master the **Indirect Method** for calculating CFO. Remember: increases in assets are a use of cash (−), and increases in liabilities are a source of cash (+).
* The **final CFO amount is identical** under the direct and indirect methods.
* Memorize the **IFRS vs. U.S. GAAP classification differences** for interest and dividends received/paid. This is a high-probability exam topic.
