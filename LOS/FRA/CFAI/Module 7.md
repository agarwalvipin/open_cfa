### **Reading 7: Analysis of Long-Term Assets**

This reading covers the accounting and analysis of long-term assets, which include tangible assets like Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E) and intangible assets like patents and goodwill. These assets are crucial as they form the productive base of a company.

#### **1. Acquisition of Intangible Assets**

**Detailed Explanation:**
We've touched on this, but this reading goes deeper. The accounting treatment for intangible assets depends on how they are acquired.

1.  **Purchased in a standalone transaction:** Capitalized at fair value (purchase price). Examples include buying a patent or a brand name from another company.
2.  **Internally Developed:**
    * **IFRS:** Research costs are expensed. Development costs are capitalized if they meet specific criteria for technical and economic viability.
    * **U.S. GAAP:** Research and development costs are both expensed, except for certain software development costs.
    * This difference means that a company developing a patent internally (under U.S. GAAP) will have lower assets and lower net income during the development period compared to a company that buys the exact same patent.
3.  **Acquired in a Business Combination:** When one company buys another, the purchase price is allocated to all the identifiable tangible and intangible assets (e.g., brand names, customer lists) of the acquired firm based on their fair values. Any remaining excess purchase price is recorded as goodwill.

**Indian Context Example:**
When **Sun Pharma** acquires another pharmaceutical company, it will record the fair value of the acquired company's drug patents as identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet. If Sun Pharma spends money internally on research for a new drug, those costs are expensed. However, once the drug enters the development phase (e.g., clinical trials), under IFRS/Ind AS, those costs can be capitalized if future economic benefits are probable.

> **CFA Exam Tip:**
> The different accounting treatments for purchased vs. internally developed intangibles are critical. An analyst must be aware that a company's balance sheet may not reflect the true value of its internally developed brands or patents because the related costs were expensed. The R&D capitalization difference between IFRS and U.S. GAAP is a recurring exam theme.

#### **2. Impairment and Derecognition of Long-Term Assets**

**Detailed Explanation:**
* **Impairment:** This is an unexpected decline in the fair value of an asset below its carrying amount (book value).
    * **PP&E and Intangibles with Finite Lives:** These are tested for impairment when there's an indication that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.
        * **IFRS:** An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is greater than the **recoverable amount**. The recoverable amount is the higher of (1) fair value less costs to sell and (2) value in use (the present value of future cash flows). The asset is written down to the recoverable amount.
        * **U.S. GAAP:** A two-step process. First, test for recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to the **undiscounted** future cash flows. If it's not recoverable, the impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the asset's **fair value**. The asset is written down to fair value.
    * **Intangibles with Indefinite Lives (including Goodwill):** These are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually.
* **Impairment Reversals:**
    * **IFRS:** Allows the reversal of impairment losses (except for goodwill) if the asset's value recovers.
    * **U.S. GAAP:** Prohibits the reversal of impairment losses for assets held for use.
* **Derecognition:** An asset is removed from the balance sheet when it is sold, exchanged, or abandoned.
    * When an asset is sold, a gain or loss is recognized on the income statement, calculated as:
        **Gain/Loss = Sales Proceeds - Carrying Amount at time of sale**

**Indian Context Example:**
Suppose a telecom company like **Vodafone Idea** has mobile network equipment (PP&E) with a carrying value of ₹100 crore. Due to intense competition and new technology, it determines that the recoverable amount of this equipment is only ₹60 crore. It must record an impairment loss of ₹40 crore, which will reduce its net income and the value of its PP&E on the balance sheet.

> **CFA Exam Tip:**
> Know the key differences in impairment testing between IFRS and U.S. GAAP (recoverable amount vs. two-step test) and the rule on reversals (allowed under IFRS, prohibited under U.S. GAAP). An impairment loss is a non-cash charge that reduces net income, similar to depreciation.

#### **3. Using Disclosures in Analysis**

**Detailed Explanation:**
The notes to the financial statements provide a wealth of information for analyzing a company's long-term assets, including:
* Depreciation and amortization methods used.
* Estimated useful lives and salvage values.
* A breakdown of assets by type (e.g., land, buildings, machinery).
* A reconciliation of the beginning and ending carrying amounts, showing additions (capex), disposals, and depreciation/impairment for the period.

**Key Ratios and Metrics:**
Analysts can use this information to calculate metrics that assess the efficiency and age of the asset base.
* **Fixed Asset Turnover:** Measures how efficiently the company generates revenue from its investment in PP&E.
* **Average Age of Assets:** Can be estimated to gauge how old the company's asset base is, which can help in forecasting future capital expenditure needs.
* **Average Remaining Life:** Estimates how many years of useful life are left in the asset base.

**Indian Context Example:**
An analyst comparing two airlines, **IndiGo** and **SpiceJet**, would look at the disclosures about their aircraft fleets. By calculating the average age of their fleets, the analyst can infer which airline might need to spend more on new aircraft in the near future. A higher fixed asset turnover for IndiGo would suggest it is generating more revenue per aircraft than SpiceJet, indicating greater operational efficiency.

> **CFA Exam Tip:**
> Be familiar with the formulas for the asset age ratios. A question might provide the necessary data (accumulated depreciation, depreciation expense, net PP&E) and ask you to calculate the average age or remaining life. Understand that a lower remaining life might imply higher future capex.

### **Reading 7: Summary**

#### **List of Formulas Used**
1.  **Gain or Loss on Sale of Asset:**
    $$\text{Gain/Loss} = \text{Sales Proceeds} - (\text{Historical Cost} - \text{Accumulated Depreciation})$$

2.  **Fixed Asset Turnover:**
    $$\text{Fixed Asset Turnover} = \frac{\text{Revenue}}{\text{Average Net Fixed Assets}}$$

3.  **Average Age of Asset:**
    $$\text{Average Age} = \frac{\text{Accumulated Depreciation}}{\text{Depreciation Expense}}$$

4.  **Average Remaining Life of Asset:**
    $$\text{Average Remaining Life} = \frac{\text{Net PP\&E}}{\text{Depreciation Expense}}$$

#### **Quick Exam-Day Pointer**
* Remember the different rules for capitalizing **internally developed intangibles** under IFRS (development costs can be capitalized) and U.S. GAAP (generally expensed).
* **Impairment losses** are recognized when an asset's carrying value exceeds its recoverable value. **IFRS allows reversals, U.S. GAAP does not** (for assets held for use).
* Use disclosures to calculate **asset age ratios** to help forecast future capital expenditures. A low remaining life may signal that significant new investment is needed.
