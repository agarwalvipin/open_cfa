### **Reading 2: Analyzing Income Statements**

This reading dives into the first of the three major financial statements. The income statement, also known as the Statement of Profit or Loss, shows a company's financial performance over a period of time.

#### **1. Revenue Recognition**

**Detailed Explanation:**
Revenue is the lifeblood of a company. Recognizing it properly is crucial. Both IFRS and U.S. GAAP now follow a converged, principles-based five-step model:

1.  **Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer.** A contract is an agreement that creates enforceable rights and obligations.
2.  **Step 2: Identify the separate performance obligations in the contract.** A performance obligation is a promise to transfer a distinct good or service. A single contract can have multiple performance obligations.
3.  **Step 3: Determine the transaction price.** This is the amount of consideration the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the goods or services.
4.  **Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations.** The total price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation based on its standalone selling price.
5.  **Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.** Revenue is recognized as the control of the goods or services is transferred to the customer. This can happen at a *point in time* (e.g., selling a product in a store) or *over time* (e.g., a construction project or a subscription service).

**Indian Context Example:**
Consider **Bharti Airtel**. When a customer signs up for a 12-month postpaid plan that includes a "free" handset:
* **Step 1:** The contract is the 12-month agreement.
* **Step 2:** There are at least two performance obligations: (1) providing the handset and (2) providing telecom services for 12 months.
* **Step 3 & 4:** Airtel must determine the total transaction price and allocate it between the handset and the service. They cannot treat the handset as free. A portion of the monthly fee is allocated to the handset and the rest to the service.
* **Step 5:** The revenue allocated to the handset is recognized upfront when the customer receives it. The revenue for the telecom service is recognized monthly over the 12-month contract period.

> **CFA Exam Tip:**
> You must know the **five steps for revenue recognition**. The exam might present a short scenario and ask you to identify the number of performance obligations or how revenue should be recognized (upfront vs. over time). Also, be aware of specific applications like long-term contracts where revenue is recognized over time based on the percentage of completion.

#### **2. Expense Recognition and Capitalization vs. Expensing**

**Detailed Explanation:**
The **matching principle** is a core concept here. It dictates that expenses should be recognized in the same period as the revenues they help generate.

* **Costs directly matched with revenues:** For example, the **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** is recognized at the same time the sale of the inventory is recorded.
* **Period Costs:** Some costs are not directly tied to a specific revenue but to a period of time. These are expensed in the period they are incurred. Examples include selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses.
* **Capitalization vs. Expensing:** Some expenditures provide benefits over multiple future periods.
    * **Expensing:** If a cost's benefit is consumed in the current period, it is expensed immediately (e.g., paying for electricity). This reduces net income in the current period.
    * **Capitalizing:** If a cost's benefit extends to future periods, it is capitalized. This means it is recorded as an asset on the balance sheet (e.g., buying a machine). The cost is then gradually recognized as an expense (depreciation or amortization) over its useful life.

**Impact of Capitalizing vs. Expensing:**
| Metric (in the year of expenditure) | Capitalizing | Expensing |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Net Income** | Higher | Lower |
| **Total Assets** | Higher | Lower |
| **Shareholders' Equity** | Higher | Lower |
| **Cash Flow from Operations (CFO)** | Higher (expenditure is CFI) | Lower (expenditure is CFO) |
| **Cash Flow from Investing (CFI)** | Lower | No effect |

**Indian Context Example:**
**Reliance Industries** spends billions on building a new refinery. This expenditure is **capitalized** as Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E) on its balance sheet. The cost is then expensed as depreciation over the refinery's useful life (e.g., 20-30 years). In contrast, the salary paid to the refinery's administrative staff is an operating expense and is **expensed** in the year it is incurred.

> **CFA Exam Tip:**
> This is a critical concept. Understand the financial statement effects of capitalizing vs. expensing. A common question is: "If a company capitalizes an expenditure instead of expensing it, what is the effect on its net income and cash from operations in the first year?" Answer: Net income is higher, and cash from operations is higher.

#### **3. Non-Recurring Items and Changes in Accounting Policy**

**Detailed Explanation:**
To forecast future performance, analysts must distinguish between recurring and non-recurring items.

* **Unusual or Infrequent Items:** These are events that are either unusual in nature or occur infrequently. They are presented as part of income from continuing operations but are shown separately. For example, restructuring charges or gains/losses from selling an asset.
* **Discontinued Operations:** This refers to a component of a company that has been disposed of or is held for sale. The net income (or loss) from this component is reported separately at the bottom of the income statement, net of tax. This allows analysts to focus on the results of the operations that will continue in the future.
* **Changes in Accounting Policy:** When a company changes an accounting principle (e.g., from one inventory method to another), it must be applied **retrospectively**. This means prior years' financial statements that are presented for comparison must be restated as if the new policy had always been in use, enhancing comparability.
* **Changes in Accounting Estimate:** When a company changes an estimate (e.g., the useful life of a machine), it is applied **prospectively**. There is no restatement of prior periods. The new estimate is used for the current and future periods.

**Indian Context Example:**
If **Dr. Reddy's Laboratories** decides to sell its entire active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) manufacturing division to focus solely on branded formulations, the profit or loss from the API division would be reported as a **discontinued operation**. This helps an analyst evaluate the performance of the core formulations business that will remain.

> **CFA Exam Tip:**
> Know the difference between **Changes in Accounting Policy (retrospective)** and **Changes in Accounting Estimate (prospective)**. Also, understand that discontinued operations are reported separately, net of tax, below income from continuing operations.

#### **4. Earnings per Share (EPS)**

**Detailed Explanation:**
EPS is a key metric for equity investors, showing the portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding common share.

* **Simple vs. Complex Capital Structure:**
    * A company has a **simple capital structure** if it has no potentially dilutive securities (like convertible bonds, convertible preferred stock, or stock options).
    * It has a **complex capital structure** if it does have such securities.
* **Basic EPS:** This is calculated for all companies.
* **Diluted EPS:** This must be calculated if the company has a complex capital structure. It shows a "what-if" scenario of what EPS would be if all dilutive securities were converted into common shares. **Diluted EPS must be less than or equal to Basic EPS.** If a security's conversion would increase EPS, it is "antidilutive" and is excluded from the calculation.

**Calculations:**
* **If-Converted Method (for convertible bonds/preferred stock):** Assumes the securities were converted at the beginning of the period. The numerator is adjusted by adding back the after-tax interest (for bonds) or the preferred dividends. The denominator is increased by the number of new common shares that would be issued.
* **Treasury Stock Method (for options/warrants):** Assumes the company receives cash from the exercise of options. It then uses this cash to repurchase its own shares at the average market price for the period. The net increase in shares (shares issued upon exercise minus shares repurchased) is added to the denominator.

**Indian Context Example:**
Many Indian tech startups issue Employee Stock Options (ESOPs) to their employees. A company like **Zomato** has a complex capital structure due to these ESOPs. When calculating its diluted EPS, it must use the Treasury Stock Method to account for the potential dilution from these options.

> **CFA Exam Tip:**
> **EPS is a very frequently tested topic.** You must know the formulas for Basic and Diluted EPS. Practice questions involving the if-converted and treasury stock methods. A common trick question involves antidilutive securities – remember they are ignored in the diluted EPS calculation.

### **Reading 2: Summary**

#### **List of Formulas Used**
1.  **Basic EPS:**
    $$\text{Basic EPS} = \frac{\text{Net Income} - \text{Preferred Dividends}}{\text{Weighted Average Number of Common Shares Outstanding}}$$

2.  **Diluted EPS (If-Converted Method for Convertible Preferred Stock):**
    $$\text{Diluted EPS} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Weighted Avg. Shares} + \text{New Shares from Conversion}}$$

3.  **Diluted EPS (If-Converted Method for Convertible Debt):**
    $$\text{Diluted EPS} = \frac{\text{Net Income} + \text{After-Tax Interest on Debt}}{\text{Weighted Avg. Shares} + \text{New Shares from Conversion}}$$

4.  **Diluted EPS (Treasury Stock Method for Options):**
    * Number of shares created from exercise = `X`
    * Proceeds from exercise = `X * Exercise Price`
    * Number of shares repurchased = `Proceeds / Average Market Price`
    * Net increase in shares = `X - Shares Repurchased`
    $$\text{Diluted EPS} = \frac{\text{Net Income} - \text{Preferred Dividends}}{\text{Weighted Avg. Shares} + \text{Net Increase in Shares from Options}}$$

#### **Quick Exam-Day Pointer**
* Remember the **5 steps of revenue recognition**.
* **Capitalizing** costs increases assets and net income in the current period compared to expensing.
* **Discontinued operations** are shown separately, net of tax.
* Changes in **accounting principle** are applied **retrospectively**; changes in **estimate** are applied **prospectively**.
* **Diluted EPS ≤ Basic EPS**. You must know how to apply the **if-converted** and **treasury stock** methods.
