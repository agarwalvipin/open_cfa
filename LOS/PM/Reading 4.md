# CFA Level 1 Portfolio Management Learning Module 4
## Basics of Portfolio Planning and Construction

---

### 1. Introduction

This module covers the critical planning stage in the portfolio management process, emphasizing the structure and contents of the **Investment Policy Statement (IPS)** and how to build a robust portfolio that aligns with an investor‚Äôs objectives and constraints.

### 2. The Investment Policy Statement (IPS)

#### What is an IPS?
An **Investment Policy Statement** is a formal written document agreed upon by the investor and portfolio manager. It outlines the client's objectives, constraints, and provides guidance for portfolio construction and review.

**Indian Example:**  
In India, most wealth advisors at banks (like HDFC or ICICI Wealth) will ask you about your goals (buying a house in Mumbai, retirement, children‚Äôs education) and help draft an IPS‚Äîeven for high-net-worth individuals and family offices.

#### *Exam Tips:*
- **Remember**: IPS = Foundation of all client-portfolio actions.  
- MCQs often present a client scenario. Pick objectives/constraints for *that profile* (age, income, and risk appetite are key).

---

### 3. **Major Components of an IPS**

- **Objectives**  
  - *Risk Objective*: How much risk can the investor tolerate?  
    *E.g.,* A senior citizen in India investing in RBI Bonds or Senior Citizens' Savings Scheme wants very low risk.
  - *Return Objective*: What return does the client seek?  
    *E.g.,* Growing corpus to ‚Çπ1 crore for a child‚Äôs US education in 15 years.

- **Constraints**  
  - *Liquidity*: How much cash is needed and when?
    - Example: For an upcoming wedding, the portfolio should have some liquid mutual funds or short-term fixed deposits.
  - *Time Horizon*: How long before the money is needed?
    - Example: Retirement planning for someone age 30 vs. 58.
  - *Tax Concerns*: Different products offer different tax treatments (ELSS funds for tax saving in India under Section 80C, versus traditional FDs taxed at marginal rates).
  - *Legal and Regulatory*: E.g., NRIs face limits on certain Indian asset classes.
  - *Unique Circumstances and ESG*: Any specific wishes (like avoiding companies with low ESG scores, or only investing in Shariah-compliant securities).

#### *Highlight:*
The IPS is personalized. Each client will have a unique IPS based on their life stage, goals, and constraints.

### 4. Gathering Client Information

Before constructing a portfolio, the advisor must collect detailed information about:
- Financial status (net worth, cash flows)
- Future obligations
- Risk profile (Use risk questionnaires; e.g., many Indian advisers use SEBI-mandated risk profiling before distributing mutual funds)

#### *Exam Pointer:*
Be able to spot missing or conflicting client constraints in MCQs (e.g., ‚ÄúWants high return but can‚Äôt tolerate any loss‚Äù).

### 5. Portfolio Construction and Capital Market Expectations

#### Capital Market Expectations:
What do you expect from the markets in terms of risk, return, inflation, correlations, etc.?  

**Indian Example:**  
- Expecting higher equity returns in a bullish period like 2017, but lower during volatile years like 2020.
- Fixed income expected returns may shift with RBI‚Äôs changes in repo rate.

---

### 6. **Strategic Asset Allocation**

Defining mix of asset classes (equity, debt, real estate, gold, cash) based on the IPS. This is the long-term "target" allocation.

**Indian Example:**  
- A young Indian engineer‚Äôs portfolio:  
  - 60% in equity funds (SBI Bluechip, Mirae Asset),  
  - 20% in gold (SGB, Gold ETFs),  
  - 20% in PPF/FDs/bonds.

**<mark>EXAM TIP:</mark>:**
You will see MCQs with pie charts or percentage allocations ‚Äî practice constructing these based on a given scenario.

---

### 7. Portfolio Construction Principles

- **Diversification is Critical:**  
  Like SIPs in Indian mutual funds ‚Äî spreading across large-cap, mid-cap, debt, and gold.

- **Alignment with IPS:**  
  Portfolio should always map back to what is agreed in the IPS.

- **Periodic Review & Rebalancing:**  
  Adjust allocation if market moves the portfolio away from targets (e.g., equity rallies, and allocation shifts from 60% ‚Üí 75%).

---

### 8. **New Developments & ESG Considerations**

- **ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance):**  
  Increasing focus among Indian (especially urban millennial) investors ‚Äî e.g., SBI Magnum Equity ESG Fund.

- **Alternative Assets:**  
  Rise in REITs, InvITs, and even Indian startups investing through crowd platforms.

---

## üî• Exam-Day Quick Pointers

- Know the sections of an IPS ‚Äî **objectives & constraints are frequently tested**.
- Understand risk appetite vs. required return (don‚Äôt confuse goals for risk tolerance).
- For given investor profiles, practice identifying the *correct* constraint or objective.
- Asset allocation and diversification: Why and How (construct simple allocation plans based on scenarios).
- ESG is increasingly relevant ‚Äî don‚Äôt ignore questions on it in Indian setting!

## üìí Key Formulas (From This Reading)

There are no numerical formulas unique to this module, but the following concepts must be well understood:
- **Risk/Return objectives**
- **Asset allocation math** (percentages)
