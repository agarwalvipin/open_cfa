### Reading 24 — Capital Investments & Capital Allocation

*(Corporate Issuers, Level I CFA Curriculum)*

---

## LOS 24.a Describe **types of capital investments**

| Bucket                                 | What it means                                     | Indian-flavoured real-world cue                                    | Exam focus                                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Maintenance / Replacement**          | Spend to keep existing capacity productive        | NTPC overhauling turbines at Korba super-thermal plant             | Know these don’t increase *capacity* but may protect ROIC     |
| **Expansion**                          | Add capacity to serve growing demand              | Amul commissioning a new dairy in Uttar Pradesh                    | Link to **NPV > 0** & demand forecasts                        |
| **New-product or strategic projects**  | Enter new lines of business                       | Reliance Jio rolling out 5G + fixed broadband                      | Often highest risk ➜ need higher hurdle rate                  |
| **Regulatory / Safety / ESG**          | Mandated by law or to meet sustainability targets | Indian refiners adding desulphurisation units for BS-VI fuel norms | May have negative stand-alone NPV but are *non-discretionary* |
| **Other** (R\&D, exploratory, options) | Early-stage, create *real options*                | Tata Motors investing in EV battery tech                           | Know link to LOS 24.d                                         |

> **Tip:** In MCQs, watch for *“increase capacity”* vs *“extend useful life”* wording—they map to different buckets.

## LOS 24.b **Describe the capital-allocation process, calculate NPV, IRR, ROIC, contrast their use**

### 1 | The process (simplified)

1. **Idea generation**
2. **Screening / preliminary NPV**
3. **Capital budgeting committee review**
4. **Post-implementation audit**&#x20;

### 2 | Core metrics & formulas

| Measure                               | Formula                                            | Interpretation                |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Net Present Value (NPV)**           | $\text{NPV} = \sum_{t=0}^{n}\dfrac{CF_t}{(1+r)^t}$ | ₹ value created today         |
| **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**     | Discount rate that sets NPV = 0                    | % return—compare with WACC    |
| **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)** | $\dfrac{\text{NOPAT}}{\text{Invested Capital}}$    | Post-tax operating efficiency |

*Example:*
Maruti Suzuki evaluates a ₹800 cr assembly line expected to throw ₹180 cr NOPAT from Year 1–10.

*NPV (10%) ≈ ₹178 cr > 0 → accept; IRR ≈ 13.6%; ROIC Year 1 ≈ 22.5% > WACC 11%.*

> **Exam hint:** If cash flows are *conventional* (- + + +), NPV and IRR give the **same accept/reject** signal—test setters love this.

## LOS 24.c **Principles & common pitfalls in capital allocation**

| Principle (what you *should* do)                       | Typical Indian pitfall to recognise in a vignette                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Base decisions on **incremental after-tax cash flows** | Using accounting profit or including sunk cost like past R\&D on Bharat Stage compliance |
| **Include working-capital changes** & salvage value    | Ignoring GST-linked receivables tied up in trade working capital                         |
| Use a **project-specific hurdle rate**                 | Applying corporate WACC to a solar-park venture despite subsidised green-loan terms      |
| Perform *post-audit* to improve forecasts              | No feedback loop after PSU capex—cost overruns repeat                                    |

> Highlight: Treat **interest expense** as part of the *discount rate*, not as a cash-flow deduction—this appears often.

## LOS 24.d **Types of real options in capital investments**

| Real option                 | One-line Indian illustration                                   | Why it matters for exam                                 |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Timing option**           | Delaying a real-estate launch until RERA clarity               | Explains why negative NPV today might still be valuable |
| **Expansion option**        | Zomato → quick-commerce (“Blinkit”) after core delivery proved | Treat NPV base + option value                           |
| **Abandonment option**      | Tata Steel exiting UK steelworks if carbon costs soar          | Reduces downside risk—adjust cash flows                 |
| **Flexibility option**      | NTPC gas-vs-coal co-firing capability                          | Allows cost optimisation under fuel price volatility    |
| **Switching option**        | Adani Ports converting a berth from coal to containers         | Similar mechanics to flexibility                        |
| **Stage / compound option** | Biocon’s phased clinical trials                                | Evaluate as series of calls                             |

## Key formulas from Reading 24

| Concept                              | Formula                                                               |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NPV                                  | $\displaystyle \sum_{t=0}^{n}\frac{CF_t}{(1+r)^t}$                    |
| IRR                                  | solve $0 = \sum_{t=0}^{n}\frac{CF_t}{(1+\text{IRR})^t}$               |
| ROIC                                 | $\text{NOPAT} / \text{Invested Capital}$                              |
| Payback                              | Years until cumulative CF = 0                                         |
| Discounted Payback                   | Same but discounted CFs                                               |
| Profitability Index                  | $\displaystyle \frac{\text{PV of future CFs}}{\text{Initial outlay}}$ |
| Terminal value in growing perpetuity | $CF_1 / (r-g)$                                                        |

*(You don’t have to memorise Payback, but it’s occasionally asked as a distractor.)*

## **High-yield exam flags**

1. **Sign convention:** Negative outlay (CF₀). If they reverse signs, IRR logic flips—common trap.
2. **Mutually exclusive projects:** Use NPV ranking, not IRR, when scale differs.
3. **Non-conventional cash-flows:** Multiple IRRs possible—choose **NPV** or **modified IRR**.
4. **Real options:** Remember they **increase** a project’s strategic value; can make negative-NPV projects acceptable.
5. **ROIC vs WACC:** Boosts EVA questions—ROIC > WACC → value creation.

## Quick exam-day pointer 🏁

> **Write “LOS 24 = NPV | IRR | ROIC + options” on your formula sheet.**
> Before the Capital Budgeting vignette, jot:
> *“after-tax incremental CF, ignore sunk, include WC & salvage, use project WACC.”*
> This 15-second anchor can save easy points when fatigue hits late in the session.

Good luck, Vipin! With these concepts tied to familiar Indian examples, the numbers—and the marks—should stick.
