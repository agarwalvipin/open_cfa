## LOS 20.a‚ÄÉCompare the organisational forms of businesses

| Form                                    | Legal identity                   | Liability of owners                                                                         | Continuity                   | Typical Indian example                   | Why it matters for CFA L1                              |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Sole Proprietorship**                 | No separate entity               | **Unlimited** ‚Äì owner‚Äôs personal assets exposed (think of your neighbourhood kirana owner)  | Ends on owner‚Äôs death        | Kirana / medical shop                    | Know that high liability risk ‚Üí higher required return |
| **General Partnership**                 | Partners = business              | Unlimited for **all** general partners                                                      | Dissolves if a partner exits | Small CA/CS practices                    | Same unlimited-liability logic, but shared             |
| **Limited Partnership (LP)**            | Separate from *limited* partners | General partner: unlimited‚ÄÉLimited partner: capped at investment                            | Depends on partnership deed  | PE / VC funds often structured as LPs    | Distinguish *general* vs *limited* in a stem           |
| **Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)** | Body corporate (LLP Act 2008)    | Limited to capital contributed                                                              | Perpetual                    | Consulting start-ups, boutique law firms | Popular Indian hybrid ‚Äì appears in item-set stems      |
| **Private Limited Company (Pvt Ltd)**   | Separate legal person            | Limited                                                                                     | Perpetual                    | Zoho Corp before IPO plans               | Sets the stage for ‚Äúprivate vs public‚Äù in LOS 20.c     |
| **Public Company / Corporation**        | Separate                         | Limited to share capital                                                                    | Perpetual                    | Reliance Industries Ltd                  | Core vehicle for later CFA readings (dividends, WACC)  |

### India-specific nuance

* **HUF (Hindu Undivided Family)** ‚Äì unique Indian quasi-partnership with joint liability of karta & coparceners (unlikely in the exam, but good context).
* **Section 8 company** ‚Äì non-profit with limited liability; shows up in NGO valuation illustrations.

### Exam-day tips

1. **Unlimited-liability flag** ‚Üí instant ‚Äúsole proprietorship or general partner‚Äù answer.
2. If you see the phrase *‚Äúowners and business are indistinguishable‚Äù* ‚Üí think sole proprietorship.
3. Memorise the **ordering of flexibility vs compliance cost**: Sole prop < LLP < Pvt Ltd < Public Ltd.

## LOS 20.b‚ÄÉDescribe key features of corporate issuers

| Feature                        | What it means                                         | Indian touch-point                                                | Why CFA cares                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Separate legal personality** | Company can own property, sue/be sued                 | TCS sues for IP breach, not its shareholders                      | Enables valuation as a going concern                |
| **Limited liability**          | Shareholder loss ‚â§ invested capital                   | Yes Bank AT-1 write-down: equity holders wiped, no further claims | Directly affects required return and cost of equity |
| **Transferable ownership**     | Shares can change hands without affecting firm        | NSE/BSE secondary trading or off-market transfers                 | Creates liquidity premium in equity valuation       |
| **Delegated management**       | Board & professional managers act on behalf of owners | Board of Infosys vs promoter group                                | Leads to agency conflicts (link to Reading 22)      |
| **Perpetual existence**        | Life not tied to any owner                            | Tata Group continues through generations                          | Allows DDM with ‚Äúinfinite‚Äù cash-flow horizon        |
| **Regulatory disclosure**      | Periodic reporting (SEBI LODR, Companies Act)         | Quarterly results, XBRL                                           | Feeds into FRA readings and analyst models          |

> **High-yield exam nugget**: ‚Äú*Limited liability plus easy transferability equals lower cost of capital and wider access to funding.*‚Äù Bullet that on your cheat sheet.

| Aspect                      | Public (listed)                          | Private (unlisted)                    | Indian illustration                                         | Exam watch-out                                      |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Access to capital**       | Broad: IPOs, FPOs, QIPs                  | Limited to private placements, PE/VC  | Zomato (pre-IPO funding rounds vs post-listing follow-on)   | Liquidity premium concept                           |
| **Disclosure & governance** | Extensive (SEBI, Clause 49)              | Minimal (but Companies Act audit)     | Paytm vs Zoho Corp                                          | Higher disclosure = lower asymmetric-info risk      |
| **Ownership dispersion**    | Widely held, free float                  | Concentrated promoters                | Reliance‚Äôs \~50 % promoter stake vs wholly-owned subsidiary | Sets up agency-cost questions                       |
| **Valuation approach**      | Market prices available ‚Äì relative & DDM | Need comparables or DCF with discount | Valuing BYJU‚ÄôS vs HDFC Bank                                 | Liquidity / size discounts appear in Equity reading |

## Formula sheet for Reading 20

Reading 20 is mostly conceptual; **no core math formula is examinable** beyond fundamental ratios you already use elsewhere (e.g., **Return on Equity = Net Income / Shareholders‚Äô Equity**). Keep your formula memory for WACC (Reading 25) and NPV/IRR (Reading 24).

## Exam-day lightning pointers üîë

1. **Underline the LOS verb**: *compare*, *describe*. Expect definition & difference questions.
2. **Unlimited vs limited liability** questions are *easy marks*‚Äîanswer in ‚â§ 20 seconds.
3. **Feature‚ÜíImpact** chain: Separate personality ‚Üí perpetual life ‚Üí DDM infinity.
4. Tie LOS 20 content to Ethics: mis-representation of organisational form = Standard I(C) Misrepresentation.
5. If stuck, apply **‚Äúrisk-return logic‚Äù**: higher owner risk (unlimited liability) ‚áí higher required return.

### Rapid-fire revision card

* **Sole prop**: owner = business, unlimited liability.
* **General partnership**: ‚â• 2 unlimited-liability partners share control.
* **LP / LLP**: at least one unlimited general partner; limited partners/LLP members capped liability.
* **Corporation**: separate legal person, limited liability, transferable shares, perpetual life, delegated management.
* **Public vs Private**: liquidity + disclosure vs control + confidentiality.

Focus on these contrasts, pair them with Indian examples you know, and you‚Äôll bank the easy points on Reading 20.

*Happy studying‚Äîsee you at the 90th percentile!*
