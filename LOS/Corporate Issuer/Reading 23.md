## LOS 23.a ‚Äî Explain the cash-conversion cycle (CCC) and compare issuers‚Äô CCCs

| Component                            | Formula         | Meaning                                                                                                                                                 | India-centric illustration |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)**     |                 | How quickly credit sales turn to cash.  Reliance Retail‚Äôs push into QR-code payments cut its DSO by \~5 days in FY 24.                                  |                            |
| **Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO)** |                 | How long inventory sits.  Maruti Suzuki‚Äôs ‚Äújust-in-time‚Äù vendor park keeps DIO near 25 days, vs. 40+ for smaller automakers.                            |                            |
| **Days Payables Outstanding (DPO)**  |                 | How long suppliers are kept waiting.  FMCG majors like HUL negotiate 45-day terms with packaging vendors.                                               |                            |
| **Operating Cycle**                  | DSO + DIO       | Cash tied up before payables.                                                                                                                           |                            |
| **Cash-Conversion Cycle**            | DSO + DIO ‚àí DPO | Net days cash is locked in operations. A **shorter CCC** frees cash; negative CCC (e-commerce giants collecting cash before paying suppliers) is ideal. |                            |

### Real-world benchmarking

| Company (FY 24)            | Sector          | CCC (days) | Insight                                            |
| -------------------------- | --------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Avenue Supermarts (D-Mart) | Grocery retail  | **7**      | Low inventory variety + immediate cash sales.      |
| Hero MotoCorp              | Auto 2-wheelers | **32**     | Higher parts stock to avoid chip shortages.        |
| Tata Steel                 | Metals          | **65**     | Long DIO for raw-material dumps; scope to tighten. |

### Exam-boosters

* **Know the sign convention:** CCC *subtracts* DPO ‚Äì common trap.
* Watch for ‚Äúseasonality‚Äù: if the vignette shows Q4 data, inventories may be high. Adjust your CCC intuition accordingly.

## LOS 23.b ‚Äî Explain liquidity and compare issuers‚Äô liquidity levels

| Ratio                  | Formula | Interpretation                                                                                                        | Indian context |
| ---------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Current**            |         | >1 ordinarily ‚Äúsafe‚Äù, but PSU banks often run at 0.6‚Äì0.8 yet survive due to RBI support.                              |                |
| **Quick (Acid-Test)**  |         | Inventory less liquid; IT services firms (e.g., Infosys) show quick ‚âà current because they carry little stock.        |                |
| **Cash**               |         | Conservative metric; startups post-IPO often flaunt >2√ó to reassure investors.                                        |                |
| **Defensive-Interval** |         | Days a firm can cover outflows with near-cash assets. NBFCs track this closely after the 2018 IL\&FS liquidity scare. |                |

> **Exam hit-list:** Current > Quick > Cash (memorise the descending numerator).

### Liquidity traps often tested

1. **Window-dressing:** Year-end sale-and-leaseback inflates cash; ratios spike temporarily.
2. **Contingent lines:** Undrawn bank limits *do not* enter numerator‚Äîwatch footnotes.

## LOS 23.c ‚Äî Describe objectives and compare methods for managing working capital & liquidity

| Objective                                     | Key levers                                                                                                                                     | India-specific example                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ensure operating liquidity at lowest cost** | - Negotiate longer supplier terms (‚Üë DPO)  <br>- Speed up collections (e-invoicing, factoring)  <br>- Optimise inventory (JIT, vendor-managed) | Zomato turned negative CCC by demanding 7-day settlement from restaurants while enjoying 60-day credit from advertising vendors. |
| **Maintain access to funding**                | - Revolving credit, CP, overdrafts  <br>- Securitisation of receivables                                                                        | Muthoot Finance issues frequent CP (rated A1+) to bridge gold-loan seasonality, lowering cost vs. long-term NCDs.                |
| **Preserve value / avoid distress**           | - Liquidity buffers (marketable securities)  <br>- Contingency planning (backup lines)                                                         | After the Yes Bank crisis, many mid-cap companies opened backup accounts with PSU banks as a contingency.                        |

### Short-term funding sources highlighted in Reading 23

| Source                                     | Typical INR cost (July 2025)                | Pros / Cons                                      |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Operating line (Cash-credit)**           | Repo + 2.5%                                 | Flexible; but callable.                          |
| **Commercial Paper**                       | T-bill + 0.8%                               | Cheap for rated issuers; bullet repayment risk.  |
| **Bankers‚Äô Acceptance / Bill Discounting** | Repo + 1.5%                                 | Shifts receivable risk to bank; stamp-duty cost. |
| **Trade Credit**                           | ‚Äú2/10 net 30‚Äù ‚âà 37% APR if discount forgone | Implicit cost often > bank borrowing.            |

> **Exam tip:** Calculate the implicit annualised cost of not taking a cash-discount; formula is  .

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Quick Exam-Day Pointers

| Pointer                                                                                                 | Why it matters                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Write CCC formula on scratch sheet immediately**                                                      | Avoid sign errors under time pressure.                                 |
| **Prioritise liquidity ratios > profitability if vignette asks ‚Äúin the short run‚Äù**                     | CFAI loves context-driven answers.                                     |
| **Remember: extending payables *increases* CCC only if it already exceeds operating cycle.**            | Common trap question.                                                  |
| **When given mixed current/non-current items, strip out non-operating pieces before computing ratios.** | Reading 23 explicitly bases metrics on *operating* assets/liabilities. |
| **Link to valuation:** Shorter CCC boosts free-cash-flow ‚Äì connect dots in item-set explanations.       |                                                                        |

### üáÆüá≥  Final Thought

Efficient working-capital management separates good Indian companies from great ones in a high-interest environment. Keep local examples (DMart, HUL, Infosys) in mind‚Äîthey make the concepts stick and score you easy recall points on exam day.

**Happy studying, Vipin‚ÄîNovember 2025 is yours!**
