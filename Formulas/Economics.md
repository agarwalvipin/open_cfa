Of course, Vipin. An essential part of preparing for the exam is having a solid grasp of the key formulas. A dedicated formula sheet helps you focus your memorization efforts on what's most likely to be tested.

Here is a comprehensive formula sheet organized by the specific reading topics you are using for your studies.

## ðŸ“Š CFA Level 1 Economics: The Ultimate Formula Sheet

### **Reading 12: Firms and Market Structures**

* **Profit Maximization Rule:** This is the core principle for any firm, regardless of market structure. Firms maximize profit by producing at the quantity where Marginal Revenue equals Marginal Cost.
    $$\text{Profit is Maximized when: } MR = MC$$

* **Economic Profit:**
    $$\text{Economic Profit} = \text{Total Revenue (TR)} - \text{Total Economic Cost (TC)}$$
    * Where Total Revenue is Price Ã— Quantity ($P \times Q$).
    * Total Economic Cost includes all explicit costs and implicit opportunity costs.

### **Reading 13: Understanding Business Cycles**

* **GDP (Expenditure Approach):** This formula breaks down a country's total economic output by who is buying it.
    $$\text{GDP} = C + I + G + (X - M)$$
    * **C:** Consumption (spending by households)
    * **I:** Investment (spending by businesses and households on capital)
    * **G:** Government spending
    * **X:** Exports
    * **M:** Imports

* **GDP (Income Approach):** This formula calculates GDP by summing all income earned within a country.
    $$\text{GDP} = \text{National Income} + \text{Capital Consumption Allowance} + \text{Statistical Discrepancy}$$

* **Unemployment Rate:**
    $$\text{Unemployment Rate} = \frac{\text{Unemployed}}{\text{Labor Force}} \times 100$$

### **Reading 14: Introduction to Fiscal Policy**

* **Fiscal Multiplier:** This measures the total impact on GDP from an initial change in government spending.
    $$\text{Fiscal Multiplier} = \frac{1}{1 - MPC(1 - t)}$$
    * **MPC:** Marginal Propensity to Consume (the fraction of new income that is spent).
    * **t:** Tax rate.

* **Government Budget Balance:**
    $$\text{Budget Balance} = \text{Tax Revenues (T)} - \text{Government Spending (G)}$$

### **Reading 15: Introduction to Monetary Policy**

* **Quantity Theory of Money:** This equation links the money supply, the velocity of money, the price level, and real output.
    $$M \times V = P \times Y$$
    * **M:** Money supply
    * **V:** Velocity of money (the number of times money changes hands)
    * **P:** Average price level
    * **Y:** Real GDP (real output)

* **Money Multiplier:** This formula calculates the maximum potential expansion of the money supply from a new deposit.
    $$\text{Money Multiplier} = \frac{1}{\text{Reserve Requirement}}$$

### **Reading 16: Geopolitics and Its Impact on the Global Economy**

* This reading is conceptual and descriptive. There are **no specific formulas** to memorize for this topic.

### **Reading 17: International Trade and Capital Flows**

* **Balance of Payments (BOP) Equation:** The sum of all accounts must equal zero.
    $$(\text{Current Account}) + (\text{Capital Account}) + (\text{Financial Account}) = 0$$

* **Fundamental Relationship (Trade, Savings & Investment):** This shows the link between a country's trade balance and its domestic economy.
    $$(X - M) = (S - I) + (T - G)$$
    * **X - M:** Net exports (the trade balance)
    * **S - I:** Private savings minus investment
    * **T - G:** Government budget balance (taxes minus spending)

### **Reading 18: Capital Flows and the Foreign Exchange Market**

* **Real Exchange Rate:** This adjusts the nominal exchange rate for differences in price levels between two countries.
    $$\text{Real Exchange Rate}_{\frac{d}{f}} = \text{Nominal Exchange Rate}_{\frac{d}{f}} \times \left( \frac{CPI_f}{CPI_d} \right)$$
    * **d:** Domestic currency
    * **f:** Foreign currency
    * **CPI:** Consumer Price Index (a measure of the price level)

### **Reading 19: Currency Exchange Rate Calculations**

* **Cross-Rate Calculation:** For currency pairs quoted against a common currency (e.g., USD).
    $$\text{Currency } \frac{A}{C} = \text{Currency } \frac{A}{B} \times \text{Currency } \frac{B}{C}$$
    * *Tip:* Always write out the currency symbols to ensure they cancel correctly.

* **Forward Rate from Forward Points:**
    $$\text{Forward Rate} = \text{Spot Rate} + \left( \frac{\text{Forward Points}}{10,000} \right)$$
    * *Note:* The denominator depends on the market convention, but 10,000 is most common for currencies quoted to four decimal places.

* **Forward Premium / Discount (%):**
    $$\% \text{ Premium or Discount} = \left( \frac{\text{Forward} - \text{Spot}}{\text{Spot}} \right) \times \left( \frac{360}{\text{Days}} \right)$$
    * A positive result indicates a premium; a negative result indicates a discount.

* **Covered Interest Rate Parity (No-Arbitrage Forward Rate):**
    $$F_{\frac{p}{b}} = S_{\frac{p}{b}} \times \frac{(1 + i_p)}{(1 + i_b)}$$
    * **F:** Forward rate
    * **S:** Spot rate
    * **p:** Price currency (the numerator)
    * **b:** Base currency (the denominator)
    * **i_p:** Interest rate for the price currency
    * **i_b:** Interest rate for the base currency
