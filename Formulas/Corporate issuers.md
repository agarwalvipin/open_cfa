## 🧾 Reading 23: Working Capital and Liquidity

### 🔢 Core Formulas

| Formula | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)** = DSO + DIO − DPO | Time from inventory purchase to cash collection |
| **Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)** = (Accounts Receivable / Sales) × 365 | Days to collect receivables |
| **Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO)** = (Inventory / COGS) × 365 | Days inventory is held |
| **Days Payables Outstanding (DPO)** = (Accounts Payable / Purchases or COGS) × 365 | Days to pay suppliers |

### 🔍 Liquidity Ratios

| Formula | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Current Ratio** = Current Assets / Current Liabilities | Overall liquidity measure |
| **Quick Ratio** = (Cash + Marketable Securities + Receivables) / Current Liabilities | Excludes inventory |
| **Cash Ratio** = (Cash + Marketable Securities) / Current Liabilities | Most conservative measure |

## 🧾 Reading 24: Capital Investments and Capital Allocation

### 🔢 Investment Appraisal

| Formula | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Net Present Value (NPV)** = ∑ [CFₜ / (1 + r)ᵗ] − Initial Investment | Measures project value |
| **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**: Set NPV = 0 and solve for r | Discount rate that sets NPV to zero |
| **Payback Period** = Time until full recovery of investment | Ignores TVM |
| **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)** = Net Operating Profit After Taxes / Invested Capital | Measures efficiency of capital use |

## 🧾 Reading 25: Capital Structure

### 🔢 Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)

$$
\text{WACC} = w_d \cdot r_d \cdot (1 - t) + w_p \cdot r_p + w_e \cdot r_e
$$

**Where:**

- \( w_d, w_p, w_e \): capital weights (debt, preferred stock, equity)
- \( r_d \): cost of debt
- \( r_p \): cost of preferred stock
- \( r_e \): cost of equity
- \( t \): corporate tax rate


> 📌 **Use market value weights** for capital components. Only debt is tax-affected.

### 🧩 Capital Structure Theory

- **Modigliani–Miller (No Taxes):** Capital structure has no impact on value.
- **MM with Taxes:** Value increases with debt due to the interest tax shield.
- **Trade-off Theory:** Optimal debt level balances tax benefits vs bankruptcy costs.

## ✅ Summary Metrics

| Metric | Comment |
|--------|---------|
| **CCC** | Shorter = more efficient cash cycle |
| **Liquidity Ratios** | Higher = better short-term solvency |
| **ROIC > WACC** | Positive value creation |
| **WACC** | Lower WACC increases firm value |
| **D/E Ratio** | Higher means more leverage, more risk |
