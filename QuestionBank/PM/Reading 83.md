Which of the following asset classes has historically demonstrated the highest average annual returns and the highest standard deviation of returns?

  - A) Long-term government bonds
  - B) Large-cap stocks
  - C) Small-cap stocks

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  * **C is correct.** Historical data shows a clear trade-off between risk and return. Asset classes with the highest average returns have also had the highest risk, measured by standard deviation. [cite_start]Small-capitalization stocks have exhibited the greatest average returns and the greatest risk over long periods. [cite: 703, 705]
  * [cite_start]**A is incorrect.** Long-term government bonds have historically shown lower average returns and lower risk compared to equities. [cite: 705]
  * [cite_start]**B is incorrect.** While large-cap stocks have higher returns and risk than bonds, they have historically been outperformed and have been less volatile than small-cap stocks. [cite: 705]

A risk-averse investor, when presented with two investments that have the same level of expected return, will choose the investment with:

  - A) higher risk.
  - B) lower risk.
  - C) an equal allocation to both.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** A risk-averse investor is one who dislikes risk. [cite_start]Therefore, given two investments offering equal expected returns, the investor will always prefer the one with less risk (i.e., lower variance or standard deviation). [cite: 717, 807]
  * **A is incorrect.** A risk-seeking investor would choose the investment with higher risk, hoping for a higher potential payout, even with the same expected return.
  * **C is incorrect.** The investor has a clear preference for lower risk and would not be indifferent between the two choices.

The set of all portfolios of risky assets that offers the highest expected return for each given level of standard deviation is called the:

  - A) minimum-variance frontier.
  - B) capital allocation line.
  - C) efficient frontier.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  * [cite_start]**C is correct.** The efficient frontier represents the set of portfolios that are "optimal" in the sense that they provide the highest possible expected return for a given level of risk (standard deviation). [cite: 800]
  * **A is incorrect.** The minimum-variance frontier includes all portfolios that have the lowest standard deviation for a given level of return. [cite_start]The efficient frontier is the upper portion of the minimum-variance frontier, starting from the global minimum-variance portfolio. [cite: 798, 799]
  * [cite_start]**B is incorrect.** The capital allocation line represents the risk-return combinations of a portfolio formed by combining a single risky portfolio with a risk-free asset. [cite: 731]

The risk-reduction benefit of diversification is *most* effective when the correlation of returns between two assets is:

  - A) close to +1.0
  - B) equal to 0.0
  - C) close to -1.0

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  * **C is correct.** The primary goal of diversification is to reduce portfolio risk. The lower the correlation of asset returns, the greater the risk-reduction benefit. [cite_start]A correlation approaching -1.0 provides the maximum possible diversification benefit, as the assets tend to move in opposite directions, smoothing out the portfolio's overall returns. [cite: 790, 818]
  * **A is incorrect.** A correlation of +1.0 means the assets move perfectly together, and there is no diversification benefit. [cite_start]The portfolio's risk is simply the weighted average of the individual assets' risks. [cite: 782]
  * **B is incorrect.** A correlation of 0.0 provides some diversification benefit, but less than a negative correlation.

A portfolio consists of two assets whose returns are perfectly positively correlated (${\\rho = +1.0}$). Asset X has a standard deviation of 10% and is weighted at 40%. Asset Y has a standard deviation of 20% and is weighted at 60%. The standard deviation of this portfolio is:

  - A) 14.0%
  - B) 15.0%
  - C) 16.0%

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  * [cite_start]**C is correct.** When two assets are perfectly positively correlated (${\\rho = +1.0}$), there is no diversification benefit, and the portfolio's standard deviation is the weighted average of the individual assets' standard deviations. [cite: 778, 782]
    $$\sigma_{portfolio} = w_X \sigma_X + w_Y \sigma_Y$$
    $$\sigma_{portfolio} = (0.40 \times 10\%) + (0.60 \times 20\%) = 4\% + 12\% = 16.0\%$$
  * **A is incorrect.** 14% would be the simple average of the standard deviations, not the weighted average.
  * **B is incorrect.** This represents an incorrect calculation.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  * **C is correct.** Liquidity refers to the ability to sell an asset quickly at a price close to its fair market value. [cite_start]It can be a major concern for securities that trade infrequently, such as low-quality corporate bonds or stocks in emerging markets. [cite: 711, 712]
  * [cite_start]**A is incorrect.** U.S. Treasury bills are considered one of the most liquid securities in the world. [cite: 820]

A portfolio manager creates a two-asset portfolio with the following characteristics:

  - Asset A: 30% weight, 18% standard deviation
  - Asset B: 70% weight, 10% standard deviation
  - Correlation of returns between A and B: 0.25

  - A) 9.9%
  - B) 10.9%
  - C) 12.6%

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

  * **A is correct.** The formula for the standard deviation of a two-asset portfolio is:
    $$\sigma_{portfolio} = \sqrt{w_A^2 \sigma_A^2 + w_B^2 \sigma_B^2 + 2 w_A w_B \sigma_A \sigma_B \rho_{AB}}$$
    [cite_start][cite: 766]
    Plugging in the values:
    $$\sigma_p = \sqrt{(0.30^2)(0.18^2) + (0.70^2)(0.10^2) + 2(0.30)(0.70)(0.18)(0.10)(0.25)}$$
    $$\sigma_p = \sqrt{(0.09)(0.0324) + (0.49)(0.01) + (0.00189)}$$
    $$\sigma_p = \sqrt{0.002916 + 0.0049 + 0.00189} = \sqrt{0.009706}$$
    $$\sigma_p \approx 0.0985 \text{ or } 9.85\%$$
  * **B is incorrect.** This would be closer to the result if the correlation were higher.
  * **C is incorrect.** This would be the weighted average of the standard deviations, which is only correct if the correlation is +1.0.

  - A) Portfolio Z is preferred to Portfolio Y.
  - B) Portfolio Y is preferred to Portfolio X.
  - C) Portfolio X is preferred to Portfolio Z.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** Rational, risk-averse investors will always prefer a portfolio that offers a higher expected return for the same level of risk. Portfolio Y has a higher expected return (12%) than Portfolio X (10%) for the same standard deviation (15%). [cite_start]Therefore, Portfolio Y is preferred to (dominates) Portfolio X, and Portfolio X is inefficient. [cite: 800, 833]
  * **A is incorrect.** Portfolio Y is preferred to Portfolio Z because it offers the same expected return (12%) for a lower level of risk (15% vs. 18%).
  * **C is incorrect.** No clear preference can be established between X and Z without knowing an investor's specific risk tolerance, as Z offers a higher return but also has higher risk.

  - B) intersects with the efficient frontier.
  - C) is tangent to the investor's highest possible indifference curve.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  * **C is correct.** The capital allocation line (CAL) shows the possible combinations of a risk-free asset and an optimal risky portfolio. An investor's indifference curves represent their preferences for risk and return. [cite_start]The optimal portfolio for that specific investor is the one that provides the highest utility, which occurs at the point where the CAL is tangent to the investor's highest possible indifference curve. [cite: 733, 825]
  * **A is incorrect.** The portfolio with the lowest possible risk on the CAL is the 100% risk-free asset, which is only optimal for the most extremely risk-averse investor.
  * [cite_start]**B is incorrect.** The capital allocation line itself is tangent to the efficient frontier at a single point (the optimal risky portfolio), but the investor's specific optimal portfolio can be any point along that line, depending on their risk preference. [cite: 731]

  - B) equal to the risk of the less risky asset.
  - C) equal to the weighted average of the two assets' risks.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

  * **A is correct.** A correlation of â€“1.0 represents the maximum possible diversification benefit.

</details>

An analyst observes that the historical return distribution for an asset class exhibits significant negative skewness and positive excess kurtosis (leptokurtosis). This observation implies that the distribution is *most likely* characterized by:

  - A) symmetrical returns with predictable volatility.
  - B) frequent small gains and a greater-than-normal probability of extreme losses.
  - C) frequent small losses and a greater-than-normal probability of extreme gains.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * [cite_start]**B is correct.** Non-normal characteristics of return distributions are important for risk analysis. [cite: 710]
      * **Negative skewness** indicates that the left tail of the distribution is longer, meaning there is a higher probability of large negative returns (losses) than large positive returns.
      * **Positive excess kurtosis** (leptokurtosis) means the distribution has fatter tails than a normal distribution, implying that extreme outcomes are more likely to occur.
      * Together, these suggest a pattern of frequent small positive returns combined with a higher-than-normal likelihood of experiencing an extreme loss.
  * **A is incorrect.** A normal distribution is symmetrical (zero skew) and has zero excess kurtosis.
  * **C is incorrect.** This describes a distribution with positive skewness.

  - A) inefficient.
  - B) efficient.
  - C) suboptimal for all investors.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** The minimum-variance frontier is the set of portfolios with the lowest possible standard deviation for any given level of expected return. The global minimum-variance portfolio is the point on this frontier with the absolute lowest risk. The portion of the minimum-variance frontier at and above this point is known as the efficient frontier. [cite_start]Any portfolio on the efficient frontier is considered efficient because no other portfolio offers a higher return for the same or lower level of risk. [cite: 799, 800]
  * **A is incorrect.** Portfolios below the global minimum-variance portfolio on the minimum-variance frontier are inefficient because for each one, there is a portfolio on the efficient frontier with the same risk but a higher expected return.
  * **C is incorrect.** Portfolios on the efficient frontier are optimal choices for some group of risk-averse investors.

  - C) 0.0135

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * [cite_start]**B is correct.** To calculate the sample variance, first find the mean return, then sum the squared deviations from the mean, and finally divide by the number of observations minus one (n-1). [cite: 810]

<!-- end list -->

1.  **Calculate the mean (${\\bar{R}}$):**
    $$\bar{R} = \frac{0.15 - 0.05 + 0.20 + 0.00 + 0.10}{5} = \frac{0.40}{5} = 0.08 \text{ or } 8.0\%$$
2.  **Calculate the sum of squared deviations:**
      - (0.15 - 0.08)Â² = (0.07)Â² = 0.0049
      - (-0.05 - 0.08)Â² = (-0.13)Â² = 0.0169
      - (0.20 - 0.08)Â² = (0.12)Â² = 0.0144
      - (0.00 - 0.08)Â² = (-0.08)Â² = 0.0064
      - (0.10 - 0.08)Â² = (0.02)Â² = 0.0004
      - **Sum = 0.0049 + 0.0169 + 0.0144 + 0.0064 + 0.0004 = 0.043**
3.  **Calculate the sample variance ($s^2$):**
    $$s^2 = \frac{\sum(R_t - \bar{R})^2}{n-1} = \frac{0.043}{5-1} = \frac{0.043}{4} = 0.01075$$

<!-- end list -->

  * **A is incorrect.** This would result from an arithmetic error.
  * **C is incorrect.** This would result from an arithmetic error, possibly by dividing by n instead of n-1.

</details>

An analyst determines an investor's optimal portfolio by finding the point of tangency between the investor's highest indifference curve and the optimal capital allocation line (CAL). The point of tangency occurs at a portfolio with a risk level below that of the optimal risky portfolio. This situation implies that the investor's optimal portfolio:

  - A) consists only of assets from the optimal risky portfolio.
  - B) is a lending portfolio, combining the risk-free asset and the optimal risky portfolio.
  - C) is a borrowing portfolio, constructed by borrowing at the risk-free rate to invest more in the optimal risky portfolio.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** The capital allocation line plots all possible combinations of a risk-free asset and a single risky portfolio. Points on the CAL between the y-axis (100% risk-free asset) and the optimal risky portfolio represent "lending" portfolios, where the investor allocates a portion of their funds to the risk-free asset. [cite_start]Since the tangency point has less risk than the optimal risky portfolio itself, it must lie on this segment of the CAL, indicating a combination of lending at the risk-free rate and investing in the risky portfolio. [cite: 730, 731]
  * **A is incorrect.** If the portfolio consisted only of the optimal risky portfolio, its risk level would be exactly that of the optimal risky portfolio, not below it.
  * **C is incorrect.** A borrowing portfolio would lie on the CAL to the right of the optimal risky portfolio, meaning it would have a higher risk level.

A portfolio manager is considering adding one of two new assets to an existing diversified portfolio. Both potential assets, Asset A and Asset B, have identical expected returns and identical individual standard deviations. Asset A has a correlation of 0.8 with the existing portfolio's returns, while Asset B has a correlation of 0.1. To achieve the greatest portfolio risk reduction, the manager should choose:

  - A) Asset A, because its higher correlation leads to more predictable combined performance.
  - B) Asset B, because its lower correlation provides a greater diversification benefit.
  - C) either asset, because their individual risk and return characteristics are the same.

<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** The key to diversification is combining assets whose returns are not highly correlated. [cite_start]The benefit of diversification, which is the reduction in portfolio risk without sacrificing expected return, is greater the lower the correlation. [cite: 790, 818] Because Asset B has a much lower correlation (0.1) with the existing portfolio than Asset A (0.8), adding it will result in a lower overall portfolio standard deviation. The lower the correlation, the greater the risk reduction.
  * **A is incorrect.** While the performance may be more "predictable," it would also be more volatile because the high correlation means the new asset will tend to move in the same direction as the rest of the portfolio, offering little to no risk-reduction benefit.
  * **C is incorrect.** Although the individual asset characteristics are identical, their relationship (correlation) to the existing portfolio is different and is the critical factor for determining the impact on portfolio risk.

Portfolio P and Portfolio Q are both located on the efficient frontier. Portfolio P has an expected return of 9% and a standard deviation of 14%. Portfolio Q has an expected return of 11% and a standard deviation of 18%. Which of the following statements about an investor's choice between these two portfolios is *most* accurate?

  - A) Any rational investor will prefer Portfolio P over Portfolio Q due to its lower risk.
  - B) Any rational investor will prefer Portfolio Q over Portfolio P due to its higher return.
  - C) The choice between Portfolio P and Portfolio Q depends on the investor's individual degree of risk aversion.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  * **C is correct.** Both portfolios are efficient, meaning that for their level of risk, they offer the highest possible return. Neither portfolio dominates the other; Portfolio Q offers a higher return but also entails higher risk. The selection between two efficient portfolios is entirely dependent on the individual investor's utility, which is a function of their personal tolerance for risk. [cite_start]A more risk-averse investor would likely prefer Portfolio P, while a less risk-averse investor may prefer Portfolio Q. [cite: 720, 800]
  * **A is incorrect.** A less risk-averse investor may be willing to take on the additional risk of Portfolio Q to earn the higher expected return.
  * **B is incorrect.** A more risk-averse investor may not find the additional 2% return of Portfolio Q sufficient compensation for taking on the additional 4% in standard deviation.
