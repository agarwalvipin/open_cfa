</details>

The Capital Market Line (CML) represents portfolios that are combinations of:

Â  - A) two different risky assets.
Â  - B) the risk-free asset and the global minimum-variance portfolio.
Â  - C) the risk-free asset and the market portfolio.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

Â  * **C is correct.** The Capital Market Line (CML) is a special case of the Capital Allocation Line (CAL). It represents the optimal set of portfolios an investor can form by combining a risk-free asset with the market portfolio, which is the tangency portfolio on the efficient frontier.
Â  * **A is incorrect.** Combinations of two risky assets form the investment opportunity set, which is represented by a curve (the efficient frontier), not the CML.
Â  * **B is incorrect.** The CML uses the market portfolio because it is the optimal risky portfolio offering the highest Sharpe ratio, not necessarily the global minimum-variance portfolio, which only minimizes risk without regard to return.

</details>

Which of the following is the *best* example of systematic risk?

Â  - A) A factory fire disrupting a company's production.
Â  - B) A key executive's unexpected departure.
Â  - C) A surprise increase in the national interest rate.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

Â  * **C is correct.** Systematic risk, also known as market risk or non-diversifiable risk, is the risk inherent to the entire market. Macroeconomic factors like changes in interest rates, inflation, and recessions affect all assets and cannot be eliminated through diversification.
Â  * **A is incorrect.** A factory fire is an event specific to one company, which is an example of nonsystematic (or idiosyncratic) risk. This risk can be mitigated through diversification.
Â  * **B is incorrect.** An executive's departure is also a firm-specific event and is therefore a nonsystematic risk.

The Security Market Line (SML) graphs the expected return for all assets and portfolios as a function of their:

Â  - A) standard deviation.
Â  - B) systematic risk (beta).
Â  - C) total risk.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

Â  * **B is correct.** The Security Market Line (SML) is the graphical representation of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). It plots the expected return of an asset or portfolio against its systematic risk, which is measured by beta. All correctly priced assets should lie on the SML.
Â  * **A is incorrect.** The Capital Market Line (CML) uses standard deviation (total risk) as its measure of risk, not the SML.
Â  * **C is incorrect.** Total risk is measured by standard deviation and is the risk measure for the CML, which only applies to efficient portfolios. The SML applies to all assets and uses systematic risk (beta).

An asset with a beta of 1.0 is expected to have:

Â  - A) the same level of systematic risk as the market portfolio.
Â  - B) no systematic risk.
Â  - C) twice the systematic risk of the market portfolio.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

Â  * **A is correct.** Beta measures an asset's sensitivity to market movements. The market portfolio has a beta of 1.0 by definition. Therefore, an asset with a beta of 1.0 has the same level of systematic risk as the market and is expected to move in line with it.
Â  * **B is incorrect.** A beta of 0 indicates no systematic risk, which is characteristic of a risk-free asset.
Â  * **C is incorrect.** A beta of 2.0 would indicate twice the systematic risk of the market portfolio.

An investor can *most effectively* eliminate nonsystematic risk by:

Â  - A) investing only in government bonds.
Â  - B) holding a well-diversified portfolio.
Â  - C) using derivative instruments to hedge.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

Â  * **B is correct.** Nonsystematic risk is firm-specific or industry-specific. It can be significantly reduced or eliminated by holding a portfolio of assets that are not perfectly correlated. As the number of assets in a portfolio increases, the impact of any single asset's specific events diminishes.
Â  * **A is incorrect.** Investing only in government bonds eliminates credit risk but concentrates exposure to interest rate risk (a systematic risk).
Â  * **C is incorrect.** Hedging can manage specific risks but is not the primary method for eliminating nonsystematic risk across an entire portfolio. Diversification is the key tool for this purpose.

</details>

Which of the following is a key assumption of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)?

Â  - A) Investors have different expectations about future returns and risks.
Â  - B) All investors can borrow and lend at the risk-free rate.
Â  - C) Transaction costs and taxes affect investment decisions.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

Â  * **B is correct.** A fundamental assumption of the CAPM is that there are no frictions in the market. This includes the assumption that investors can borrow and lend unlimited amounts at a single, universal risk-free rate of interest.
Â  * **A is incorrect.** The CAPM assumes investors have homogeneous expectations, meaning they all agree on the expected returns, volatilities, and correlations of all assets.
Â  * **C is incorrect.** The CAPM assumes a frictionless market, which means there are no transaction costs or taxes.

The Sharpe ratio measures a portfolio's:

Â  - A) excess return per unit of systematic risk.
Â  - B) total return per unit of total risk.
Â  - C) excess return per unit of total risk.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

Â  * **C is correct.** The Sharpe ratio is calculated as (Portfolio Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Portfolio Standard Deviation. The numerator is the excess return (or risk premium), and the denominator is the total risk (measured by standard deviation).
Â  * **A is incorrect.** Excess return per unit of systematic risk (beta) is measured by the Treynor ratio.
Â  * **B is incorrect.** The Sharpe ratio uses excess return (return above the risk-free rate), not total return, in its numerator to measure the reward for taking on risk.

Â  - question_type: mcq
Â  - difficulty: easy
Â  - tags: [CAL, Risk-Free Asset, Portfolio]

</details>

When a risk-free asset is combined with a portfolio of risky assets, the resulting Capital Allocation Line (CAL) is:

Â  - A) a curved line representing the trade-off between risk and return.
Â  - B) a straight line representing the risk and return combinations of the new portfolio.
Â  - C) a vertical line at the risk level of the risky portfolio.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

Â  * **B is correct.** Because the risk-free asset has zero standard deviation and zero correlation with the risky portfolio, the resulting possible combinations of the two form a straight line in risk-return space. This line is the Capital Allocation Line (CAL).
Â  * **A is incorrect.** A curved line (the efficient frontier) represents combinations of different risky assets, not a risky asset and a risk-free one.
Â  * **C is incorrect.** The risk of the combined portfolio varies as the allocation between the risk-free and risky assets changes, so it cannot be a vertical line.

</details>

An analyst has gathered the following data:
- Risk-Free Rate: 3%
- Expected Market Return: 9%
- Beta of Stock XYZ: 1.5

Using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), the expected return for Stock XYZ is *closest* to:

Â  - A) 9.0%
Â  - B) 12.0%
Â  - C) 13.5%

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

Â  * **B is correct.** The CAPM formula is: Expected Return = Risk-Free Rate + Beta Ã— (Expected Market Return â€“ Risk-Free Rate).
   Expected Return = 3% + 1.5 Ã— (9% â€“ 3%) = 3% + 1.5 Ã— (6%) = 3% + 9% = 12.0%.
Â  * **A is incorrect.** This would be the result if the beta were 1.0 (3% + 1.0 * 6% = 9%).
Â  * **C is incorrect.** This result incorrectly multiplies beta by the market return instead of the market risk premium (3% + 1.5 * 9% = 16.5%) or miscalculates the premium.

</details>

A security has an analyst's forecasted return of 12% and a beta of 1.2. If the risk-free rate is 4% and the expected market return is 10%, this security is *most likely*:

Â  - A) undervalued.
Â  - B) fairly valued.
Â  - C) overvalued.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

Â  * **A is correct.** First, calculate the required return using the SML/CAPM:
   Required Return = 4% + 1.2 Ã— (10% â€“ 4%) = 4% + 1.2 Ã— 6% = 4% + 7.2% = 11.2%.
   Since the forecasted return (12%) is greater than the required return (11.2%), the asset is expected to generate a positive alpha and plots *above* the SML. An asset that is expected to deliver a return greater than required for its risk is considered undervalued.
Â  * **B is incorrect.** The security would be fairly valued if its forecasted return was equal to its required return of 11.2%.
Â  * **C is incorrect.** The security would be overvalued if its forecasted return was less than its required return of 11.2%.

A portfolio had a return of 12%, and the risk-free rate was 2%. The portfolio's standard deviation was 16%. The Sharpe ratio of the portfolio is *closest* to:

Â  - A) 0.625
Â  - B) 0.750
Â  - C) 0.875

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

Â  * **A is correct.** The formula for the Sharpe Ratio is (Portfolio Return â€“ Risk-Free Rate) / Portfolio Standard Deviation.
   Sharpe Ratio = (12% â€“ 2%) / 16% = 10% / 16% = 0.625.
Â  * **B is incorrect.** This would be the result if the numerator was the total return instead of the excess return: 12% / 16% = 0.750.
Â  * **C is incorrect.** This would be the result if the standard deviation was 12% instead of 16% and the numerator was 10.5%.

Investors are not compensated for bearing nonsystematic risk because it:

Â  - A) is only relevant for short-term investments.
Â  - B) can be eliminated through diversification at little to no cost.
Â  - C) is positively correlated with market returns.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

Â  * **B is correct.** The core principle of modern portfolio theory and the CAPM is that the market only rewards investors for bearing risk that cannot be diversified away (systematic risk). Since nonsystematic risk can be easily and cheaply eliminated by holding a well-diversified portfolio, rational investors will not pay a premium for an asset with high nonsystematic risk, nor will they expect a higher return for bearing it.
Â  * **A is incorrect.** Nonsystematic risk is relevant across all time horizons but can be diversified away.
Â  * **C is incorrect.** Nonsystematic risk is, by definition, uncorrelated with market returns. Systematic risk is what is correlated with the market.

A portfolio located on the Capital Market Line (CML) to the right of the market portfolio is *best* described as:

Â  - A) a portfolio containing only a subset of market assets.
Â  - B) a lending portfolio, with some funds invested at the risk-free rate.
Â  - C) a leveraged portfolio, formed by borrowing at the risk-free rate to invest more in the market.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

Â  * **C is correct.** Points on the CML to the right of the market portfolio represent portfolios with more risk and higher expected return than the market itself. These are achieved by borrowing funds at the risk-free rate and investing more than 100% of the investor's equity into the market portfolio. This is known as a leveraged or borrowing portfolio.
Â  * **A is incorrect.** Any portfolio on the CML, by definition, is a combination of the risk-free asset and the market portfolio.
Â  * **B is incorrect.** A lending portfolio involves investing a portion of funds in the risk-free asset and lies on the segment of the CML between the risk-free asset and the market portfolio.

Â  - A) 8.33
Â  - B) 10.00
Â  - C) 11.67

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

Â  * **A is correct.** The Treynor ratio measures a portfolio's excess return per unit of systematic risk. The formula is: Treynor Ratio = (Portfolio Return â€“ Risk-Free Rate) / Portfolio Beta.
   Treynor Ratio = (14% â€“ 4%) / 1.2 = 10 / 1.2 = 8.33.
Â  * **B is incorrect.** This is the numerator only (14% - 4% = 10%).

The market model is a simplified return-generating model that describes the return of an asset as:

Â  - A) a function of its own past returns and volatility.
Â  - B) linearly related to the return of the market index.
Â  - C) determined by multiple macroeconomic factors.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

Â  * **B is correct.** The market model, a type of single-index model, posits that an asset's return is linearly dependent on the return of a market index. The model is expressed as Ri = Î±i + Î²i Ã— Rm + ei, where Î±i is the alpha, Î²i is the beta, Rm is the market return, and ei is the residual error term representing nonsystematic risk.
Â  * **A is incorrect.** This describes a time-series model, not the market model, which links an asset's return to the market's return.
Â  * **C is incorrect.** Models that use multiple macroeconomic factors are known as multi-factor models, which are an extension beyond the single-index market model.

Â  - B) +0.8%
Â  - C) +1.0%

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

Â  * **B is correct.** Jensen's alpha measures the excess return of a portfolio over its required return as predicted by the CAPM.
   1. Calculate the portfolio's required return (CAPM): E(R) = Rf + Î² Ã— (E(Rm) â€“ Rf) = 3% + 1.4 Ã— (11% â€“ 3%) = 3% + 1.4 Ã— 8% = 3% + 11.2% = 14.2%.
   2. Calculate Jensen's Alpha: Alpha = Actual Return â€“ Required Return = 15% â€“ 14.2% = +0.8%.
Â  * **A is incorrect.** A miscalculation might lead to this answer. For example, using a market risk premium of 8.2% would yield this result.
Â  * **C is incorrect.** This might result from rounding errors or a miscalculation of the required return.

**Explanation:**

Â  * **B is correct.** The beta of a portfolio is the weighted average of the betas of the individual assets in the portfolio.
   Portfolio Beta = (Weight_A Ã— Beta_A) + (Weight_B Ã— Beta_B)
   Portfolio Beta = (0.60 Ã— 1.3) + (0.40 Ã— 0.8) = 0.78 + 0.32 = 1.10.
Â  * **A is incorrect.** This is a simple average of the two betas (1.3 + 0.8) / 2 = 1.05, which ignores the portfolio weights.
Â  * **C is incorrect.** This is a miscalculation of the weighted average.

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

Â  * **C is correct.** This is the fundamental distinction. The SML plots return against systematic risk (beta) and can be used to value any asset or portfolio. The CML plots return against total risk (standard deviation) and is only valid for efficient portfolios that are combinations of the risk-free asset and the market portfolio.
Â  * **A is incorrect.** This statement reverses the risk measures for the two lines.

</details>

The M-squared (MÂ²) measure evaluates a portfolio's performance by:

Â  - A) comparing its return directly to the market return.
Â  - B) creating a hypothetical portfolio with the same total risk as the market and comparing its return.
Â  - C) calculating the portfolio's return per unit of systematic risk.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

Â  * **B is correct.** M-squared (MÂ²) adjusts a portfolio's performance to compare it directly with the market portfolio. It does this by creating a new hypothetical portfolio (P*) that combines the evaluated portfolio with the risk-free asset in such a way that the total risk (standard deviation) of P* is equal to the market's standard deviation. The MÂ² is the return of this hypothetical portfolio minus the market's return, showing the risk-adjusted outperformance in percentage terms.
Â  * **A is incorrect.** MÂ² is a risk-adjusted comparison, not a direct comparison of returns.
Â  * **C is incorrect.** This describes the Treynor ratio, which measures excess return per unit of systematic risk (beta).

</details>

An asset has a beta of 0.8 and an analyst's forecast for its return is 10%. The risk-free rate is 2% and the market risk premium is 7%. Based on this information, the analyst should conclude that the asset is:

Â  - A) overvalued, with an alpha of -2.4%.
Â  - B) undervalued, with an alpha of +2.4%.
Â  - C) fairly valued, with an alpha of 0.0%.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

Â  * **B is correct.** This requires calculating the asset's required return via CAPM and comparing it to the analyst's expected return to find the mispricing (alpha).
   1. Calculate the required return (using SML): E(R) = Risk-Free Rate + Beta Ã— (Market Risk Premium) = 2% + 0.8 Ã— (7%) = 2% + 5.6% = 7.6%.
   2. Calculate the expected alpha: Alpha = Forecasted Return â€“ Required Return = 10% â€“ 7.6% = +2.4%.
   Because the asset is expected to return 2.4% more than what is required for its level of systematic risk, it is considered undervalued.
Â  * **A is incorrect.** This would imply the forecasted return was lower than the required return.
Â  * **C is incorrect.** The asset would be fairly valued only if its forecasted return equaled its required return of 7.6%.

An analyst is choosing between two portfolios for a client who will hold this as their only investment.
- Portfolio A: Return=12%, Std Dev=18%, Beta=1.1
- Portfolio B: Return=10%, Std Dev=12%, Beta=0.9
- The risk-free rate is 3%.

Which portfolio should the analyst choose and why?

Â  - A) Portfolio A, because it has a higher Treynor ratio.
Â  - B) Portfolio B, because it has a higher Sharpe ratio.
Â  - C) Portfolio A, because it has a higher absolute return.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

Â  * **B is correct.** When the portfolio represents the entirety of an investor's assets, the investor is not diversified. Therefore, total risk (standard deviation) is the relevant risk measure, and the Sharpe ratio is the appropriate performance metric.
   1. Sharpe Ratio A = (12% â€“ 3%) / 18% = 9% / 18% = 0.50.
   2. Sharpe Ratio B = (10% â€“ 3%) / 12% = 7% / 12% = 0.583.
   Since Portfolio B has a higher Sharpe ratio, it provides a better return for each unit of total risk and is the superior choice for an undiversified investor.
Â  * **A is incorrect.** The Treynor ratio uses beta and is only appropriate for evaluating a portfolio that is part of a larger, well-diversified portfolio where nonsystematic risk has been eliminated.
Â  * **C is incorrect.** Choosing based on absolute return alone ignores the risk taken to achieve that return. Portfolio B offers a better risk-adjusted return.

An investor has $100,000 in equity. They borrow an additional $50,000 at the risk-free rate of 4% and invest the entire $150,000 in the market portfolio. The market portfolio has an expected return of 10% and a standard deviation of 16%. The expected return and standard deviation of the investor's final portfolio are *closest* to:

Â  - A) Return = 13%, Standard Deviation = 16%
Â  - B) Return = 13%, Standard Deviation = 24%
Â  - C) Return = 15%, Standard Deviation = 24%

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

Â  * **B is correct.** This is a leveraged portfolio calculation.
   1. Determine the weights: The weight in the market portfolio is $150,000 / $100,000 = 1.5 (150%). The weight in the risk-free asset is -$50,000 / $100,000 = -0.5 (-50%), representing the borrowing.
   2. Calculate the portfolio's expected return: E(Rp) = (Weight_market Ã— E(Rm)) + (Weight_rf Ã— Rf) = (1.5 Ã— 10%) + (â€“0.5 Ã— 4%) = 15% â€“ 2% = 13%.
   3. Calculate the portfolio's standard deviation: Ïƒp = Weight_market Ã— Ïƒ_market = 1.5 Ã— 16% = 24%. (The risk-free asset has zero standard deviation).
Â  * **A is incorrect.** The standard deviation is also leveraged and should be higher than the market's standard deviation.
Â  * **C is incorrect.** The expected return calculation is incorrect. The cost of borrowing must be subtracted.

A fund reports an average return of 11% with a standard deviation of 20%. The market portfolio had a return of 9% with a standard deviation of 16%. The risk-free rate is 3%. The fund's M-squared (MÂ²) measure is *closest* to:

Â  - A) 0.4%
Â  - B) 1.0%
Â  - C) 2.0%

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

Â  * **A is correct.** M-squared measures what the fund would have returned if it had the same risk as the market, allowing for a direct comparison of returns.
   1. Calculate the fund's Sharpe Ratio: (11% â€“ 3%) / 20% = 8% / 20% = 0.40.
   2. Calculate the return of the hypothetical portfolio (P*) with risk equal to the market: E(R_P*) = Rf + (Sharpe Ratio_fund Ã— Ïƒ_market) = 3% + (0.40 Ã— 16%) = 3% + 6.4% = 9.4%.
   3. Calculate M-squared: MÂ² = E(R_P*) â€“ E(R_market) = 9.4% â€“ 9% = 0.4%. This indicates the fund outperformed the market by 0.4% on a risk-adjusted basis.
Â  * **B is incorrect.** This is a miscalculation.
Â  * **C is incorrect.** This would be the simple difference in returns (11% - 9% = 2%), which ignores risk.

For a particular stock, an analyst determines the following based on a market model:
- Beta (Î²): 1.2
- Standard deviation of the market's returns (Ïƒ_m): 15%
- Standard deviation of the stock's residual error term (Ïƒ_e): 10%

The total risk (variance) of the stock is *closest* to:

Â  - A) 0.0324
Â  - B) 0.0424
Â  - C) 0.0549

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

Â  * **B is correct.** Under the single-index market model, the total variance of a stock is the sum of its systematic variance and its nonsystematic (residual) variance.
   1. Calculate Systematic Variance: (Î²Â² Ã— Ïƒ_mÂ²) = (1.2Â² Ã— 0.15Â²) = 1.44 Ã— 0.0225 = 0.0324.
   2. Identify Nonsystematic Variance: This is the square of the standard deviation of the residuals = (Ïƒ_eÂ²) = 0.10Â² = 0.0100.
   3. Calculate Total Variance: Systematic Variance + Nonsystematic Variance = 0.0324 + 0.0100 = 0.0424.
Â  * **A is incorrect.** This is only the systematic component of the total variance.
Â  * **C is incorrect.** This is a miscalculation, perhaps from summing standard deviations before squaring.

Â  - tags: [CML, Borrowing Rate, Lending Rate]

</details>

If the rate at which investors can borrow is higher than the rate at which they can lend (the risk-free rate), the Capital Market Line (CML) will:

Â  - A) remain a single straight line.
Â  - B) become curved above the market portfolio.
Â  - C) become "kinked" at the market portfolio, with a flatter slope for leveraged portfolios.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

Â  * **C is correct.** When borrowing and lending rates differ, the CML is no longer a single straight line. The segment from the lending rate (risk-free rate) to the market portfolio has one slope. The segment for leveraged portfolios, which requires borrowing at a higher rate, will have a flatter slope because the cost of borrowing is higher. This higher cost reduces the excess return per unit of risk for leveraged positions, creating a "kink" in the CML at the point of the market portfolio.
Â  * **A is incorrect.** A single straight line relies on the simplifying assumption of a single risk-free rate for both borrowing and lending.
Â  * **B is incorrect.** The line does not become curved; it remains linear on both segments but changes slope at the kink.
