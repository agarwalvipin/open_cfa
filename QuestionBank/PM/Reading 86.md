</details>

A primary reason for creating a written investment policy statement (IPS) is to:

  - A) guarantee a specific rate of return for the client.
  - B) ensure investment decisions are compatible with the client's goals and risk tolerance.
  - C) select the best-performing securities for the upcoming year.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * [cite_start]**B is correct.** A written IPS is designed to ensure that the client's investment goals, in terms of risk and return, are well understood and that the manager's actions are compatible with the client's risk tolerance. [cite: 1073, 1076] It serves as a plan to guide the investment process.
  * [cite_start]**A is incorrect.** An IPS does not guarantee returns; it sets objectives and constraints for managing the portfolio. [cite: 1075]
  * **C is incorrect.** An IPS establishes the strategic framework for the portfolio; it is not a tool for short-term security selection.

</details>

Which of the following is *least likely* to be a major component of an investment policy statement (IPS)?

  - A) A statement of the duties and responsibilities of the investment manager.
  - B) A list of specific securities to be purchased for the portfolio.
  - C) Procedures for rebalancing the portfolio.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** An IPS outlines the strategic asset allocation and the client's objectives and constraints, but it does not specify the individual securities to be bought or sold. Security selection occurs during the execution phase of the portfolio management process, guided by the IPS.
  * [cite_start]**A is incorrect.** A statement of duties and responsibilities for the manager, custodian, and client is a standard component of an IPS. [cite: 1078]
  * [cite_start]**C is incorrect.** The IPS typically includes procedures to deal with investment discipline, such as how and when portfolio allocations should be rebalanced. [cite: 1079]

Which of the following is best described as an investment constraint?

  - A) A desired return of 9% per year.
  - B) A need to withdraw funds for a down payment on a house next year.
  - C) A preference for investing in technology stocks.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * [cite_start]**B is correct.** A need to withdraw funds in the near future is a liquidity constraint, which is one of the major types of investment constraints that must be specified in an IPS. [cite: 1093, 1128]
  * [cite_start]**A is incorrect.** A desired return is an example of a return objective, not a constraint. [cite: 1129]
  * **C is incorrect.** A preference for a particular sector is a unique circumstance, which is a type of constraint, but the need for cash is a more direct and universally recognized liquidity constraint.

</details>

When specifying asset classes for the purpose of strategic asset allocation, it is desirable for the correlation of returns to be:

  - A) high within asset classes and high among asset classes.
  - B) low within asset classes and high among asset classes.
  - C) high within asset classes and low among asset classes.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  * [cite_start]**C is correct.** For asset classes to be effective in portfolio construction, they should contain securities that behave similarly, meaning correlations should be relatively high *within* each asset class. [cite: 1101] [cite_start]The benefit of diversification comes from combining asset classes that behave differently, meaning correlations should be low *among* asset classes. [cite: 1102, 1130]
  * **A is incorrect.** High correlation among asset classes would reduce the benefits of diversification.
  * **B is incorrect.** Low correlation within an asset class would suggest it is not a well-defined asset class, as its components do not perform similarly.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  * [cite_start]**A is incorrect.** Security selection refers to deviating from index weights on individual securities *within* an asset class. [cite: 1113]
  * [cite_start]**C is incorrect.** Risk budgeting is a process that sets an overall risk limit for a portfolio and allocates portions of that risk to different sources, such as tactical allocation and security selection. [cite: 1118]

<details>

  * [cite_start]**A is correct.** An absolute return objective is stated in terms of a specific target return, such as 8% annually, independent of market performance. [cite: 1139]
  * [cite_start]**B is incorrect.** A relative return objective is stated relative to a benchmark, for example, "outperform the S\&P 500 Index by 2% per year." [cite: 1139]
  * **C is incorrect.** This is a return objective, not a risk objective. [cite_start]An absolute risk objective would be stated as a limit on losses, such as "do not lose more than 5% in any calendar year." [cite: 1083]

An investor needs to accumulate a down payment for a home she intends to purchase in two years. This situation will *most likely* have the greatest impact on which of the following constraints in her investment policy statement?

  - A) Tax situation
  - B) Time horizon
  - C) Unique circumstances

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** A two-year goal is a short time horizon. [cite_start]Generally, the shorter an investorâ€™s time horizon, the less risk and more liquidity the portfolio should have. [cite: 1093] [cite_start]This short horizon will be a dominant constraint, favoring low-risk and highly liquid investments for the down payment funds. [cite: 1094, 1095]
  * **A is incorrect.** While taxes are always a consideration, the short time horizon is the most defining constraint for this specific goal.
  * **C is incorrect.** While the home purchase is a unique circumstance, its primary implication is on the time horizon and liquidity constraints.

An IPS that specifies the portfolio's annual return should fall within 4% of a broad equity market index's return is an example of a:

  - A) relative risk objective.
  - B) absolute risk objective.
  - C) relative return objective.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

  * **A is correct.** A relative risk objective constrains the portfolio's risk relative to a benchmark. [cite_start]Stating that the portfolio's return must be within a certain range of an index's return is a way of controlling tracking error, which is a measure of relative risk. [cite: 1137]
  * [cite_start]**B is incorrect.** An absolute risk objective would be stated in absolute terms, such as a maximum percentage or dollar loss, without reference to a benchmark. [cite: 1083, 1085]
  * **C is incorrect.** While it references a return, the constraint is on the *volatility* of the return *relative* to a benchmark, making it a risk objective. [cite_start]A relative return objective would be to "outperform the index by 1%." [cite: 1139]

In a situation where a client's ability to take risk is high, but their willingness to take risk is low, the portfolio manager should *most appropriately*:

  - A) use the client's high ability to take risk to set the strategic asset allocation.
  - B) use the client's low willingness to take risk as the dominant factor in setting the asset allocation.
  - C) refuse to manage the client's portfolio due to the conflict.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** When ability is high but willingness is low, the advisor should not force the client into a portfolio that makes them uncomfortable. The low willingness to take risk will dominate the portfolio construction. [cite_start]The advisor may attempt to educate the client over time, but the initial portfolio should reflect the client's lower risk tolerance. [cite: 1092]
  * **A is incorrect.** Forcing a risk-averse client into a high-risk portfolio, even if they can financially afford the risk, is inappropriate and could lead to the client making poor decisions (e.g., selling at a market bottom) due to panic.
  * **C is incorrect.** This conflict does not necessarily require the manager to refuse the client. It requires careful management and education, starting with a more conservative portfolio.

  * [cite_start]**B is incorrect.** Short-term deviations from the strategic allocation are known as tactical asset allocation. [cite: 1112, 1147]

In recent years, alternative investments such as hedge funds and private equity have gained prominence as distinct asset classes in strategic asset allocation. The primary reason for this is that they:

  - A) offer returns that have low correlations with traditional asset classes like stocks and bonds.
  - B) are now fully regulated and transparent, similar to mutual funds.
  - C) have high correlations with traditional asset classes, making them good substitutes.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

  * [cite_start]**A is correct.** Asset classes are specified to maximize diversification benefits, which is achieved by combining asset classes with low correlations of returns between them. [cite: 1102] [cite_start]Alternative investments have gained prominence because their performance has historically shown low correlation with traditional equity and fixed-income markets, thus providing significant diversification benefits. [cite: 1104, 1105]
  * **B is incorrect.** Alternative investments, particularly hedge funds and private equity, remain largely unregulated and less transparent than traditional investments.

After defining the investable asset classes, a portfolio manager uses an optimization program to plot an efficient frontier. The strategic asset allocation for the client is then determined by selecting the portfolio on the efficient frontier that:

  - A) has the highest possible expected return.
  - B) has the lowest possible standard deviation.
  - C) best meets the risk and return requirements detailed in the IPS.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  * **C is correct.** The efficient frontier represents a set of portfolios with the best possible risk-return tradeoffs. [cite_start]The manager's role is to combine the objectives and constraints from the IPS with the opportunities presented by the efficient frontier to identify the single portfolio that is most suitable for that specific client. [cite: 1108, 1109]
  * **A is incorrect.** The portfolio with the highest return also has the highest risk, which is likely to be unsuitable for most investors.
  * **B is incorrect.** The portfolio with the lowest risk (the global minimum-variance portfolio) also has a relatively low return, which may not meet the client's return objectives.

**Scenario:** A 72-year-old widow has a large investment portfolio that is her sole source of support. Her spending needs are high relative to the portfolio's size. In meetings, she expresses a strong desire to invest in speculative small-cap stocks, hoping to "get rich quick" like some of her friends.

In developing her IPS, the financial advisor should conclude that:

  - A) the client's high willingness to take risk should guide the asset allocation.
  - B) the client's low ability to take risk should be the dominant factor in the asset allocation.
  - C) the client's long time horizon allows for an aggressive portfolio.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** This client has a high *willingness* to take risk, as shown by her speculative desires. However, her *ability* to take risk is very low. She has a short time horizon (due to her age), high liquidity needs (portfolio is her sole support), and relies on the portfolio for living expenses. A significant loss would be devastating. [cite_start]In cases where willingness is high but ability is low, the low ability to take risk must prevail in the advisor's assessment. [cite: 1091]
  * **A is incorrect.** Following her high willingness would be irresponsible, as it would expose her to a level of risk her financial situation cannot support.
  * **C is incorrect.** At age 72, her investment time horizon is short, not long, which further constrains her ability to take risk.

An investor's IPS contains the following:

  * **Return Objective:** Outperform a global equity index by 2% annually.
  * **Constraint:** A lump sum equal to 40% of the initial portfolio value is needed in 18 months for a non-negotiable business acquisition.

These two specifications create a conflict primarily because:

  - A) the high return objective requires a long time horizon, while the liquidity constraint creates a short time horizon for a large portion of the portfolio.
  - B) the return objective is relative while the liquidity constraint is absolute.
  - C) outperforming a global equity index is generally not possible over an 18-month period.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

  * [cite_start]**A is correct.** The return objective (outperforming a global equity index) implies a portfolio heavily weighted toward risky equities, which is only suitable for an investor with a long time horizon. [cite: 1094] However, the liquidity constraint (needing 40% of the portfolio in 18 months) creates a very short time horizon for a substantial portion of the assets. [cite_start]Investing funds needed in the short term into a volatile, equity-heavy portfolio is inappropriate. [cite: 1095] The manager must reconcile this by separating the portfolio into two components with different time horizons and risk profiles.
  * **B is incorrect.** While true that one is relative and one is absolute, this is not the source of the conflict. The conflict is between the risk implied by the return goal and the risk capacity dictated by the time horizon/liquidity constraint.
  * **C is incorrect.** While difficult, outperformance is not impossible. The issue is not the possibility of achieving the return, but the appropriateness of the risk required to attempt it given the constraint.

  * [cite_start]**C is correct.** Risk budgeting is the process of allocating an overall risk limit to various activities. [cite: 1118] By allocating 75% of the portfolio's risk to the systematic risk of the strategic asset allocation, the manager is making a clear statement that the long-term policy mix is the most important driver of results and the primary area where risk should be taken. This is the core of a disciplined, long-term approach.
  * **A is incorrect.** This describes tactical asset allocation, which has only been budgeted 15% of the portfolio's risk.
  * **B is incorrect.** This describes security selection, which has been budgeted only 10% of the portfolio's risk.

A university endowment's IPS is updated to incorporate a strict negative screening policy, prohibiting any investment in companies involved in fossil fuels, tobacco, or weapons manufacturing. When evaluating the performance of the endowment's portfolio, it would be *most appropriate* to measure its performance against:

  - A) a broad market index, such as a global equity index.
  - B) the single best-performing asset class in the portfolio for that year.
  - C) a custom or specialized benchmark that also excludes the prohibited sectors.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  * [cite_start]**C is correct.** When a portfolio's investment universe is constrained by negative screening, measuring its performance against a broad market index is unlikely to be appropriate. [cite: 1122] A fair comparison requires a benchmark that is subject to the same constraints. [cite_start]Therefore, a custom benchmark or a commercially available index that excludes the same sectors should be used. [cite: 1123, 1150]
  * **A is incorrect.** Using a broad market index is inappropriate because it includes securities that the endowment is forbidden from owning. This would create an unfair comparison, especially if the excluded sectors perform very well or very poorly.
  * **B is incorrect.** Evaluating performance against the best-performing asset class is not a valid benchmarking practice.

An advisor drafts an IPS for a new client. It states: "The client requires a 9% annualized return to meet long-term goals. The client also has a low risk tolerance and specifies that the portfolio should experience no decrease in value over any 12-month period." The primary conflict within these statements is between the:

  - A) return objective and the risk objective.
  - B) client's circumstances and the stated purpose of the IPS.
  - C) return objective and the client's tax situation.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

  * **A is correct.** There is a fundamental conflict between the stated return objective and the risk objective. A 9% annualized return objective likely requires a significant allocation to growth assets like equities, which carry substantial risk of loss. [cite_start]The absolute risk objective of "no decrease in value" over a 12-month period implies a portfolio of nearly risk-free assets (e.g., Treasury bills), which would offer a much lower expected return. [cite: 1084] [cite_start]The return expectations are not compatible with the stated risk tolerance. [cite: 1075, 1140] The advisor must work with the client to reconcile these mutually exclusive goals.
  * **B is incorrect.** The client's circumstances are what lead to these objectives; the conflict is between the objectives themselves.
  * **C is incorrect.** The client's tax situation is not mentioned and is not the source of this particular conflict.
