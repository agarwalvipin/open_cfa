The primary conclusion of modern portfolio theory is that:

  - A) holding a single, well-performing security is optimal for maximizing returns.
  - B) the risk of a portfolio is the weighted average of the individual securities' risks.
  - C) the extra risk of holding a single security is not rewarded with higher expected returns.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  * **C is correct.** Modern portfolio theory emphasizes that evaluating investments in the context of a full portfolio is superior to analyzing them in isolation. [cite_start]A key finding is that the concentration risk (unsystematic risk) from holding only a single security is not compensated with higher expected returns. [cite: 996]
  * [cite_start]**A is incorrect.** Holding a single security, even a good one, exposes the investor to significant unsystematic risk that can be reduced through diversification without necessarily lowering expected returns. [cite: 995, 997]
  * **B is incorrect.** The risk of a portfolio is only a weighted average of individual security risks if all securities are perfectly correlated. [cite_start]Diversification can reduce portfolio risk below this weighted average. [cite: 999]

The first step in the portfolio management process is the:

  - A) feedback step.
  - B) execution step.
  - C) planning step.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  * **C is correct.** The portfolio management process begins with the planning step. [cite_start]This involves analyzing the investor's objectives and constraints and creating a written investment policy statement (IPS). [cite: 1005]
  * [cite_start]**A is incorrect.** The feedback step is the third and final major step, involving monitoring, rebalancing, and performance evaluation. [cite: 1005, 1006]
  * [cite_start]**B is incorrect.** The execution step is the second major step, where the portfolio is actually constructed based on the plan. [cite: 1005, 1061]

In a defined contribution pension plan, the investment risk is borne entirely by the:

  - A) employee.
  - B) employer.
  - C) plan sponsor.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

  * **A is correct.** In a defined contribution (DC) plan, the firm contributes a specified sum but makes no promise about the future value of the assets. [cite_start]The employee makes the investment decisions and therefore assumes all the investment risk. [cite: 1017, 1018]
  * [cite_start]**B is incorrect.** The employer (or plan sponsor) bears the investment risk in a defined benefit plan. [cite: 1022]
  * **C is incorrect.** The plan sponsor is typically the employer, who bears the risk in a defined benefit plan, not a defined contribution plan.

  - A) traded on exchanges between investors throughout the day.
  - B) issued in a fixed number at inception.
  - C) bought from and sold to the fund company at the net asset value (NAV).

<details>

Which of the following institutional investors typically has the longest investment time horizon and the lowest liquidity needs?

  - A) A bank
  - B) An endowment
  - C) An insurance company

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** Endowment funds are established to provide ongoing financial support for a specific purpose, often in perpetuity. [cite_start]This gives them a very long time horizon and low liquidity needs, allowing for a higher risk tolerance. [cite: 1011, 1014]
  * [cite_start]**A is incorrect.** Banks have short-term liabilities (deposits) and thus have a short time horizon and high liquidity needs. [cite: 1014]
  * **C is incorrect.** Insurance companies need to manage their assets to pay out future claims, which can be uncertain. [cite_start]This results in relatively low risk tolerance and high liquidity needs. [cite: 1014]

</details>

A diversification ratio is calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation of a portfolio's returns to the weighted average standard deviation of the returns of its component securities. A lower diversification ratio indicates:

  - A) greater risk-reduction benefits from diversification.
  - B) a portfolio that is likely equally weighted.
  - C) lower returns for the portfolio.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

  * **A is correct.** A lower diversification ratio signifies a greater risk-reduction benefit from diversification. [cite_start]It means the portfolio's risk is significantly lower than the weighted average risk of the individual securities, which is the goal of diversification. [cite: 999]
  * [cite_start]**B is incorrect.** An equal-weighted portfolio does not necessarily provide the greatest risk reduction or result in the lowest diversification ratio. [cite: 1000]
  * **C is incorrect.** Diversification primarily addresses risk; its effect on returns is not directly indicated by the diversification ratio. [cite_start]The goal is to reduce risk without necessarily reducing expected returns. [cite: 997]

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

[cite: 1005, 1061, 1062]
  * [cite_start]**A is incorrect.** Monitoring and rebalancing are part of the feedback step. [cite: 1006, 1063]

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Explanation:**

  * [cite_start]**C is correct.** Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are similar to mutual funds but are traded on exchanges like individual stocks, allowing for intraday buying and selling. [cite: 1070]
  * [cite_start]**A is incorrect.** Open-end mutual funds are priced once per day after the market closes, and transactions occur directly with the fund company at NAV. [cite: 1041]

**Scenario:** A portfolio manager is reviewing the investment policy statements for three new institutional clients.

  - **Client A:** A university endowment with a perpetual time horizon.
  - **Client B:** A property and casualty insurance company with unpredictable future claims.
  - **Client C:** A commercial bank whose liabilities are primarily short-term customer deposits.

Which client is most likely to have the highest risk tolerance?

  - A) Client A
  - B) Client B
  - C) Client C

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

  * **A is correct.** Client A, the university endowment, has a perpetual time horizon and typically low liquidity needs. [cite_start]This long-term focus allows it to tolerate higher levels of short-term volatility in pursuit of higher long-term returns. [cite: 1011, 1014]
  * [cite_start]**B is incorrect.** The insurance company (Client B) faces unpredictable claims, which necessitates a focus on liquidity and a lower risk tolerance to ensure it can meet its obligations. [cite: 1014]
  * [cite_start]**C is incorrect.** The bank (Client C) has short-term liabilities (deposits that can be withdrawn at any time), requiring a short investment horizon, high liquidity, and low risk tolerance. [cite: 1014]

A companyâ€™s retirement plan promises to pay its retirees an annual income equal to 1.5% of their final salary for each year of service. If the planâ€™s investments perform poorly, the entity that will suffer the shortfall is the:

  - A) company (the employer).
  - B) employees.
  - C) government.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

  * **A is correct.** This describes a defined benefit (DB) pension plan, as the firm promises a specific payment to employees after retirement. [cite_start]In a DB plan, the employer (the company) is responsible for ensuring the assets are sufficient to meet the promised future payments and therefore bears all the investment risk. [cite: 1019, 1022]
  * [cite_start]**B is incorrect.** The employees bear the investment risk in a defined contribution plan, where their final retirement sum depends entirely on investment performance. [cite: 1018]
  * **C is incorrect.** While governments may insure some pension plans, the primary investment risk in a DB plan falls on the employer.

</details>

An investor holds a portfolio consisting of a single stock, believing it to be the "best" available. From a portfolio perspective, this approach is suboptimal primarily because:

  - A) diversification can reduce risk without necessarily reducing the portfolio's expected return.
  - B) holding a single stock guarantees a lower return than the market average.
  - C) the expected return of a single stock cannot be accurately measured.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

  * **A is correct.** The core of the portfolio perspective is diversification. By holding a portfolio of investments instead of a single one, an investor can reduce firm-specific (unsystematic) risk without necessarily sacrificing expected return. [cite_start]The risk from holding only a single security is generally not rewarded. [cite: 995, 996, 997]
  * **B is incorrect.** Holding a single stock does not guarantee a lower return; it could outperform or underperform the market. The issue is the uncompensated risk, not a guaranteed underperformance.
  * **C is incorrect.** While forecasting is difficult, the expected return of a single stock can be estimated. The main drawback is the risk profile, not the inability to measure expected return.

<details>

  * [cite_start]**A is incorrect.** The planning step focuses on developing the IPS by understanding client needs and objectives. [cite: 1005, 1059]

  - A) Passive strategies typically have higher management fees.
  - B) There are questions about the ability of active managers to consistently add value.
  - C) Passive strategies have become more accessible to a wide range of investors.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

  * **A is correct.** Passive management strategies, such as investing in index funds, are known for their lower fees compared to active management. [cite_start]This cost advantage is a key driver of their growing popularity, making this statement the least likely reason. [cite: 1033, 1040]
  * [cite_start]**B is incorrect.** A significant factor in the shift to passive investing is the challenge active managers face in consistently outperforming their benchmarks after fees, leading investors to question the value of paying for active management. [cite: 1040]
  * **C is incorrect.** The proliferation of low-cost index funds and ETFs has made passive investing strategies readily available to almost all investors, contributing to their growth.

  - A) An open-end mutual fund
  - B) A separately managed account (SMA)
  - C) An exchange-traded fund (ETF)

<details>

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** A separately managed account (SMA) is a portfolio owned by a single investor and managed according to that investorâ€™s specific needs and preferences. [cite_start]This allows for a high degree of customization that is not possible with commingled funds like mutual funds or ETFs. [cite: 1051, 1072]
  * [cite_start]**A is incorrect.** A mutual fund pools money from many investors, and the portfolio is managed for the collective group, not tailored to an individual. [cite: 1066]
  * [cite_start]**C is incorrect.** An ETF, like a mutual fund, follows a specific strategy or index for all its shareholders and cannot be customized for an individual investor. [cite: 1070]

  * [cite_start]**A is incorrect.** Banks have very short time horizons and high liquidity needs due to the nature of their liabilities. [cite: 1014]

  * **A is incorrect.** Hedge funds are lightly regulated, and their strategies are often opaque. Mutual funds are heavily regulated and must provide significant disclosure.
  * [cite_start]**B is incorrect.** Hedge funds are typically sold only to a limited number of "qualified" or wealthy investors and have very high minimum investment requirements, often $250,000 or more. [cite: 1054, 1055]

  - C) high risk tolerance and low liquidity needs.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** An insurance company must manage its assets to ensure it can pay out claims. While the timing of some claims (like life insurance) is more predictable than others (like property damage), the overriding need is to meet obligations. [cite_start]This leads to a relatively low risk tolerance and a need for sufficient liquidity. [cite: 1014]
  * **A is incorrect.** High risk tolerance is not appropriate given the need to pay future liabilities. This profile is more suited to an endowment.
  * **C is incorrect.** High risk tolerance and low liquidity needs are characteristic of investors like foundations or endowments, not insurance companies.

  - C) In a DB plan, the employer promises a periodic payment to the employee after retirement.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  * [cite_start]**C is correct.** A defined benefit (DB) plan is characterized by the firm's promise to make periodic payments to employees after they retire, with the benefit amount typically based on a formula involving years of service and salary. [cite: 1019, 1020, 1021]
  * **A is incorrect.** In a DB plan, the employee's retirement benefit is defined by the plan's formula; it is the employer's liability that is uncertain. [cite_start]The employee's benefit in a DC plan is uncertain. [cite: 1017]
  * [cite_start]**B is incorrect.** In a DC plan, the employer's contribution is a defined amount or percentage for each period; it is the final value of the account that is uncertain. [cite: 1015, 1016]

Portfolio diversification provides the greatest risk reduction benefit when the securities in the portfolio have:

  - A) high positive correlation.
  - B) zero correlation.
  - C) high negative correlation.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  * **C is correct.** The benefits of diversification are directly related to the correlation between the assets in the portfolio. The lower the correlation (i.e., the closer it is to -1.0), the greater the reduction in portfolio risk. High negative correlation means the assets tend to move in opposite directions, smoothing out the portfolio's overall return path. [cite_start]While not explicitly stated in this reading, this is a core concept of modern portfolio theory, which this reading introduces. [cite: 998, 1003]
  * **A is incorrect.** High positive correlation means the assets tend to move together, which provides minimal risk reduction benefit.
  * **B is incorrect.** Zero correlation provides better diversification benefits than positive correlation, but less than negative correlation.

**Scenario:** An investor is considering three pooled investment vehicles that all track an index of relatively illiquid, high-yield municipal bonds.

  - **Vehicle X:** An open-end mutual fund.
  - **Vehicle Y:** A closed-end fund traded on the NYSE.
  - **Vehicle Z:** An exchange-traded fund (ETF).

During a period of significant market panic where many investors are seeking to sell their high-yield bond holdings, which vehicle is *most likely* to see its market price trade at a significant discount to its net asset value (NAV)?

  - A) Vehicle X
  - B) Vehicle Y
  - C) Vehicle Z

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** A closed-end fund (Vehicle Y) has a fixed number of shares that trade on an exchange based on supply and demand from investors. The underlying portfolio consists of illiquid bonds. During a panic, selling pressure from shareholders will drive down the market price of the fund's shares. Because the fund manager cannot easily sell the underlying illiquid bonds to meet redemptions (as there are no redemptions), a large gap can open up between the falling share price and the more slowly-adjusting, stale NAV of the underlying assets. [cite_start]This creates a significant discount to NAV. [cite: 1041, 1069]
  * **A is incorrect.** An open-end fund (Vehicle X) must redeem shares at NAV. [cite_start]While it may face challenges selling its illiquid holdings to meet redemptions (potentially forcing it to suspend redemptions), its price is, by definition, tied to NAV. [cite: 1041]
  * **C is incorrect.** An ETF's (Vehicle Z) price is kept close to its NAV by an arbitrage mechanism involving authorized participants. While this mechanism can become strained during periods of stress, leading to premiums or discounts, the fixed structure and investor selling pressure of a closed-end fund often lead to more persistent and significant discounts in such scenarios.

</details>

**Scenario:** Two companies sponsor defined benefit (DB) pension plans.

  - **Company Alpha** is a young, growing technology firm with a young workforce. Its DB plan is overfunded.
  - **Company Beta** is a mature, stable manufacturing firm with an aging workforce nearing retirement. Its DB plan is significantly underfunded.

Compared to Company Alpha's plan, the investment portfolio for Company Beta's plan will *most likely* have a:

  - A) higher risk tolerance and a longer time horizon.
  - B) lower risk tolerance and a shorter time horizon.
  - C) higher risk tolerance and a shorter time horizon.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** Company Beta's plan has two key issues that reduce its risk tolerance and shorten its time horizon. First, its workforce is aging, meaning liabilities (pension payments) are due sooner, shortening the time horizon. Second, the plan is underfunded, meaning the primary objective must be to meet its existing obligations without taking excessive risk that could worsen the shortfall. [cite_start]This necessitates a lower risk tolerance. [cite: 1019, 1022] In contrast, Company Alpha has a longer time horizon (younger workers) and is overfunded, which gives it a much greater ability to take on risk.
  * **A is incorrect.** This profile describes Company Alpha's plan, which has a long horizon and a high ability to take risk.
  * **C is incorrect.** The short time horizon is correct for Beta, but its underfunded status and the proximity of its liabilities demand a lower, not higher, risk tolerance.

</details>

During the feedback step of the portfolio management process, a manager notes that a client, who has not sold any shares, has incurred a significant capital gains tax liability for the year. The client's portfolio is composed entirely of actively managed, open-end equity mutual funds. The *most likely* cause of the tax liability is that:

  - A) the client should have used ETFs instead of mutual funds.
  - B) the mutual funds realized and distributed capital gains to shareholders.
  - C) the client's IPS was not correctly specified in the planning step.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** Open-end mutual funds pass through any net capital gains they realize during the year to their shareholders, typically through an annual distribution. These distributions are taxable to the shareholder in the year they are received, even if the shareholder did not sell any of their own shares. [cite_start]Active trading within the fund by the fund manager is a common cause of these capital gains. [cite: 1050]
  * **A is incorrect.** While ETFs are generally more tax-efficient due to their creation/redemption process, simply stating the client "should have used" them doesn't explain the cause of the current liability. The core issue is the structure of the mutual fund and the gains it realized.
  * **C is incorrect.** While the client's tax situation should have been considered in the IPS, the direct cause of the tax liability is the action of the mutual fund manager realizing gains, not a flaw in the IPS itself.

</details>

An institutional investor wants to gain exposure to a specific, highly complex quantitative strategy. However, the investor is concerned about commingling assets with other investors and wants full transparency into the portfolio's holdings at all times. The investor is *least likely* to achieve these objectives by investing in a:

  - A) separately managed account (SMA).
  - B) private equity fund.
  - C) hedge fund.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

This question requires synthesizing the characteristics of several complex investment vehicles.

  * **B is correct.** Private equity funds are classic examples of commingled, opaque investment vehicles. Investors' capital is pooled to buy entire companies, and there is very little transparency into the day-to-day operations or valuations. [cite_start]They are fundamentally unsuitable for an investor demanding no asset commingling and full transparency. [cite: 1056, 1057]
  * [cite_start]**A is incorrect.** An SMA is the ideal structure for this investor, as it provides a portfolio owned by a single investor with full transparency and customization. [cite: 1051]
  * **C is incorrect.** While hedge funds are also pooled vehicles, it is plausible (though not guaranteed) that a large institutional investor could negotiate for a fund-of-one structure or a managed account that deploys the hedge fund's strategy, offering transparency. However, private equity's nature of buying whole companies makes this separation and transparency fundamentally impossible, making it the *least* likely option. [cite_start]The core characteristic of private equity is the illiquid, pooled buyout of entire operating companies. [cite: 1053]

A manager is constructing a portfolio in the execution step of the portfolio management process. She calculates that the weighted average standard deviation of her selected securities is 15%, while the optimized portfolio's standard deviation is 10.5%. The portfolio's diversification ratio is:

  - A) 0.70, indicating that diversification has increased the portfolio's risk-adjusted return.
  - B) 1.43, indicating that the securities have a high degree of correlation.
  - C) 0.70, indicating that diversification has reduced the portfolio's risk by 30% relative to the weighted average.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

This question requires both calculation and interpretation.

  * **C is correct.** The diversification ratio is the portfolio's standard deviation divided by the weighted average standard deviation of its components. Here, it is 10.5% / 15% = 0.70. [cite_start]A ratio of 0.70 means the portfolio's risk is only 70% of the weighted average risk of the individual securities, representing a 30% reduction in risk due to diversification effects. [cite: 999]
  * **A is incorrect.** While reducing risk for a given level of return improves the risk-adjusted return, the diversification ratio itself is a measure of risk reduction, not risk-adjusted return.
  * **B is incorrect.** The calculation is inverted (15 / 10.5). A ratio greater than 1.0 is not typical for a diversified portfolio.

</details>

A large, traditional asset management firm, known for its equity and fixed-income mutual funds, decides to launch a new division focused on managing private equity and real estate funds. This move is *most likely* motivated by a desire to:

  - A) reduce the overall profit margins of the firm.
  - B) access asset classes with potentially higher fees and profit margins.
  - C) shift the firm's business model entirely to passive management.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** The text notes a trend of traditional asset managers moving into the alternative investment space. [cite_start]This is because alternative asset classes, such as private equity and real estate, tend to command higher fees and have higher profit margins than traditional equity and fixed-income products. [cite: 1037, 1038]
  * **A is incorrect.** Moving into higher-margin businesses would be expected to increase, not reduce, overall firm profitability.
  * **C is incorrect.** Private equity and real estate are quintessential examples of active management. This move represents a deeper push into active management, not a shift towards passive strategies.
