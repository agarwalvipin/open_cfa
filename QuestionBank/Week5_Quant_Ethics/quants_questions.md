Which of the following sampling methods ensures that every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected?

- A) Stratified random sampling
- B) Simple random sampling
- C) Convenience sampling

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: B**

  **Explanation:**

  Simple random sampling is defined as a method where each item or person in the population has an equal likelihood of being included in the sample. Stratified random sampling involves dividing the population into subgroups and then sampling, which doesn't guarantee every individual member has an equal chance across the entire population, though within strata selection is random. Convenience sampling selects based on ease of access and does not ensure equal probability.

According to the central limit theorem, the distribution of sample means will be approximately normal if the sample size is:

- A) Greater than or equal to 10.
- B) Greater than or equal to 30.
- C) Equal to the population size.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: B**

  **Explanation:**

  The central limit theorem states that for simple random samples of size *n* from a population, the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal probability distribution as the sample size becomes large. A common rule of thumb for "sufficiently large" is a sample size *n* â‰¥ 30.

The standard error of the sample mean is calculated as:

- A) The population standard deviation divided by the sample size.
- B) The sample standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.
- C) The population variance divided by the sample size.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: B**

  **Explanation:**

  The standard error of the sample mean, when the population standard deviation ($\sigma$) is unknown (which is usually the case), is estimated by dividing the sample standard deviation (*s*) by the square root of the sample size (*n*). The formula is $s_{\bar{x}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$. If the population standard deviation were known, it would be $\sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$.

An investment analyst wants to survey bond portfolio managers about their use of derivatives. She divides the population of managers into three groups based on portfolio size (small, medium, large) and then draws a random sample of managers from each group, ensuring the proportion from each group in her sample matches the proportion in the population. This sampling method is best described as:

- A) Simple random sampling
- B) Systematic sampling
- C) Stratified random sampling

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: C**

  **Explanation:**

  Stratified random sampling involves dividing the population into smaller groups (strata) based on one or more distinguishing characteristics. A random sample is then taken from each stratum, and the results are pooled. The size of the samples from each stratum is often based on the size of the stratum relative to the population, as described in the question. This ensures representation from all key subgroups.

A researcher studying investment advisor behavior across a large country first divides the country into geographic regions. She then randomly selects five regions. From these five selected regions, she surveys all investment advisors. This is an example of:

- A) Stratified random sampling
- B) One-stage cluster sampling
- C) Two-stage cluster sampling

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: B**

  **Explanation:**

  Cluster sampling involves dividing a population into clusters, where each cluster is assumed to be representative of the overall population. In one-stage cluster sampling, a random sample of clusters is selected, and all data within those selected clusters are included in the sample. Since the researcher surveys *all* advisors in the selected regions (clusters), it's one-stage cluster sampling.

Holding other factors constant, as the sample size increases, the standard error of the sample mean will:

- A) Increase.
- B) Decrease.
- C) Remain unchanged.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: B**

  **Explanation:**

  The standard error of the sample mean is calculated as $s_{\bar{x}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$ (or $\sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ if population standard deviation is known). As the sample size (*n*) increases, the denominator ($\sqrt{n}$) increases, causing the standard error to decrease. This indicates that larger samples tend to provide more precise estimates of the population mean.

An analyst is studying the average risk tolerance of financial advisors in a country. He divides the country into states (clusters). He then randomly selects 10 states and from each of these 10 states, he randomly selects 20 financial advisors to survey. This sampling method is *most likely* to have a higher sampling error than simple random sampling primarily because:

- A) The advisors within each selected state may be more similar to each other than to advisors in other states.
- B) The sample size of 200 advisors (10 states * 20 advisors) is too small.
- C) Randomly selecting states introduces more bias than randomly selecting individual advisors directly from the entire population.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: A**

  **Explanation:**

  This is an example of two-stage cluster sampling. A key assumption for cluster sampling to be as efficient as simple random sampling is that each cluster should be representative of the overall population. If advisors within a state (cluster) tend to have similar risk tolerances (i.e., the cluster is not as diverse as the population), then the sample may not fully capture the overall population variability, leading to potentially higher sampling error compared to a simple random sample of the same total size. While sample size (B) can affect sampling error, the primary issue with cluster sampling relates to the representativeness of the clusters. (C) describes the process of cluster sampling, not necessarily why it would have higher error than simple random sampling if clusters are not representative.

A population of annual company revenues is known to be highly skewed to the right. An analyst takes a sample of 20 companies. According to the central limit theorem, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be:

- A) Approximately normal because the population is skewed.
- B) Highly skewed to the right, similar to the population.
- C) Closer to normal than the population distribution, but likely still somewhat skewed due to the small sample size.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: C**

  **Explanation:**

  The central limit theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches normality as the sample size increases, generally for *n* â‰¥ 30. While the CLT applies regardless of the population distribution's shape, with a small sample size (n=20) from a highly skewed population, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will likely still exhibit some skewness, although it will be less skewed and more normal-shaped than the original population distribution. If the sample size were larger (e.g., n â‰¥ 30), then option A would be more accurate.

An analyst uses bootstrap resampling to estimate the standard error of the median return for a sample of 50 hedge funds. Which of the following best describes why bootstrap might be preferred over a traditional formula-based approach for the standard error of the median?

- A) Bootstrap provides an exact analytical formula for the standard error of the median.
- B) Bootstrap can estimate the sampling distribution and standard error for statistics like the median, where simple analytical formulas may not exist or be robust.
- C) Bootstrap is computationally less intensive than calculating the median for 50 observations.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: B**

  **Explanation:**

  One of the key advantages of bootstrap resampling is its ability to estimate the sampling distribution and standard error for a wide variety of statistics, including those (like the median) for which simple, robust analytical formulas for the standard error might not be readily available or may rely on restrictive assumptions. Bootstrap does not provide an exact analytical formula; it generates an empirical sampling distribution. It is computationally intensive, not less.

Consider two methods for sampling 100 bonds from a large bond index to replicate its duration characteristics:
Method 1 (Stratified): Divide the index into 10 duration-based strata. Randomly select 10 bonds from each stratum.
Method 2 (Cluster): Divide the index into 50 clusters based on issuer type. Randomly select 2 clusters and include all bonds from these 2 clusters (assuming this results in approximately 100 bonds).

Which method is generally expected to produce a sample with lower sampling error with respect to duration, and why?

- A) Method 1, because selecting from every stratum ensures representation across all duration categories.
- B) Method 2, because focusing on specific issuer types (clusters) reduces overall variability.
- C) Both methods will likely have similar sampling error as they both involve random selection.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: A**

  **Explanation:**

  Stratified random sampling (Method 1) is generally preferred when the goal is to ensure representation across specific characteristics (like duration). By sampling from each duration stratum, the analyst ensures that the sample reflects the duration distribution of the population (the index). Cluster sampling (Method 2) risks higher sampling error if the selected clusters are not individually representative of the entire population's duration profile. If, for instance, the two selected issuer types have very different duration characteristics from the overall index, the sample's duration may not be representative.

Consider a right-tailed test. If the calculated test statistic is very large and positive, the p-value will be:

- A) Very small, leading to a failure to reject the null hypothesis.
- B) Very large, leading to a failure to reject the null hypothesis.
- C) Very small, leading to a rejection of the null hypothesis (assuming it's less than $\alpha$).

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

In a right-tailed test, a very large positive test statistic indicates that the sample result is far into the right tail of the distribution, away from the value specified by the null hypothesis in the direction of the alternative hypothesis. The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as or more extreme than the one calculated, assuming the null hypothesis is true. Therefore, a very large positive test statistic will correspond to a very small p-value. If this p-value is less than the significance level ($\alpha$), the null hypothesis will be rejected.

An analyst wants to test if the variance of monthly returns for a stock is equal to 0.0016. A sample of 24 monthly returns yields a sample variance of 0.001444. The calculated chi-square test statistic is *closest* to:

- A) 20.76
- B) 21.66
- C) 25.56

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

The chi-square test statistic for a single population variance is calculated as:
$\chi^2 = \frac{(n-1)s^2}{\sigma_0^2}$
where:
n = sample size = 24
sÂ² = sample variance = 0.001444
$\sigma_0^2$ = hypothesized population variance = 0.0016

$\chi^2 = \frac{(24-1) \times 0.001444}{0.0016}$
$\chi^2 = \frac{23 \times 0.001444}{0.0016}$
$\chi^2 = \frac{0.033212}{0.0016} \approx 20.7575$

This is closest to 20.76. This scenario matches the example data provided in the text for a chi-square test. [cite: 3241, 4370, 4383, 4385]

A Type II error is the failure to reject the null hypothesis when it is false. This error is *most likely* to occur when the:

- A) True population parameter is very different from the hypothesized parameter, and the sample size is large.
- B) True population parameter is close to the hypothesized parameter, and the sample size is small.
- C) Significance level is set very high, and the sample size is large.

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

A Type II error means failing to detect a difference when one actually exists. This is more likely if the true difference is small (i.e., the true parameter is close to the hypothesized one) because the effect is harder to detect. A small sample size also reduces the power of the test, making it harder to reject a false null hypothesis. A high significance level makes it easier to reject the null, thus reducing Type II errors (and increasing power). [cite: 3241, 4276, 4288, 4290]

An analyst is examining a small dataset (n=15) of company returns that appears to be significantly skewed and has several outliers. To test a hypothesis about the central tendency of these returns, the analyst should *most appropriately* consider using a:

- A) t-test, because the population variance is unknown.
- B) z-test, because the central limit theorem applies.
- C) Nonparametric test.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

Parametric tests like the t-test and z-test often rely on assumptions of normality or large sample sizes for the central limit theorem to apply. Given the small sample size (n=15), significant skewness, and presence of outliers, the assumptions for parametric tests are likely violated. In such situations, a nonparametric test, which makes fewer assumptions about the underlying distribution, is generally more appropriate. [cite: 3241, 4422, 4425, 4426]
