Which of the following entities can claim compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS)?

- A) A software vendor that develops GIPS-compliant performance calculation software.
- B) An investment management firm that manages assets for clients.
- C) An individual financial analyst who prepares GIPS-compliant reports for their clients.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: B**

  **Explanation:**

  The GIPS standards are designed for investment management firms to ensure fair representation and full disclosure of their investment performance. While software vendors can produce GIPS-compliant software and analysts can prepare GIPS-compliant reports, only investment management firms that actually manage assets can claim compliance with GIPS on a firm-wide basis.

What is the primary purpose of using composites in performance reporting under GIPS?

- A) To ensure that only the best-performing portfolios are presented to prospective clients.
- B) To provide a measure of a firm's aggregate performance by combining all portfolios managed by the firm.
- C) To provide a fair representation of a firm's performance for a given investment strategy or objective by grouping similar discretionary portfolios.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: C**

  **Explanation:**

  Composites are aggregations of one or more portfolios managed according to a similar investment mandate, objective, or strategy. Their purpose is to provide a fair and complete representation of a firm's track record for a particular investment strategy, preventing firms from cherry-picking their best-performing accounts.

David Lee, CFA, is a portfolio manager. He learns from a friend who works at a regulatory agency that a company whose stock is in his clients' portfolios will soon announce an investigation into its accounting practices. This information is not yet public. Lee immediately sells the stock from his clients' accounts. Which Standard did Lee most likely violate?

- A) Standard II(A) Material Nonpublic Information.
- B) Standard III(A) Loyalty, Prudence, and Care.
- C) Standard V(A) Diligence and Reasonable Basis.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: A**

  **Explanation:**

  Lee acted on material nonpublic information. The information about the impending investigation is material because it would likely affect the stock's price, and it is nonpublic. Standard II(A) prohibits members and candidates from acting or causing others to act on such information. [cite: 2599, 3080]

When defining the "firm" for GIPS compliance purposes, which of the following is most appropriate?

- A) The specific branch office where a star portfolio manager works.
- B) The corporation, subsidiary, or division that is held out to clients and prospects as a distinct business entity.
- C) Only those segments of the business that have consistently outperformed their benchmarks.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: B**

  **Explanation:**

  For GIPS compliance, the firm must be defined as the distinct business entity that is held out to clients or prospective clients. If a firm has multiple geographic locations operating under the same brand, the definition of the firm should encompass all such locations. [cite: 2999, 3023, 3024]

A client informs their portfolio manager, Sarah Chen, CFA, that they are involved in illegal tax evasion activities related to assets outside of the portfolio Chen manages. According to Standard III(E) Preservation of Confidentiality, what is Chen's most appropriate course of action regarding this information?

- A) Chen must immediately report the client's activities to the relevant legal authorities.
- B) Chen must keep this information confidential as it pertains to a client.
- C) Chen may have an obligation to report the activities if required by law, and the Standard would not prevent this.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: C**

  **Explanation:**

  Standard III(E) Preservation of Confidentiality requires members to keep client information confidential. However, there are exceptions. One exception is if the information concerns illegal activities on the part of the client. In such cases, members may have an obligation to report the activities to authorities, and the Standard would not prevent this. If disclosure is required by law, Chen must disclose it.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

Michael, a CFA candidate, works for an investment bank. He learns that his firm is about to issue a "buy" recommendation for a particular stock. Before the recommendation is made public, Michael purchases shares of the stock for his own account. This action is:

- A) Permissible if he believes the stock is undervalued.
- B) A violation of Standard VI(B) Priority of Transactions.
- C) Permissible if his firm does not have a specific policy against it.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: B**

  Standard VI(B) Priority of Transactions requires that investment transactions for clients and employers must have priority over investment transactions in which a Member or Candidate is the beneficial owner. Michael's purchase for his own account before the recommendation is public and before clients have had an opportunity to act is a violation of this standard (front-running). [cite: 2855, 2856, 3125]

- C) Firms are only required to document their input data sources if they are seeking GIPS verification.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

An investment manager, Tom, creates a marketing brochure for his firm. The brochure highlights a composite that has shown exceptional performance over the past three years. However, the composite was only created six months ago by backfilling the performance of a select group of currently existing, well-performing portfolios. This practice is most likely a violation of:

- A) Standard I(C) Misrepresentation.
- B) Standard III(D) Performance Presentation.
- C) Both A and B.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: C**

  **Explanation:**

  This practice violates Standard I(C) Misrepresentation because it knowingly misleads prospective clients about the composite's actual history and how it was constructed. It also violates Standard III(D) Performance Presentation, which requires performance information to be fair, accurate, and complete. Backfilling a composite with only currently existing, well-performing portfolios and not disclosing this methodology is misleading. [cite: 2568, 2699, 2889]

Which statement about GIPS verification is *most* accurate?

- A) Verification is mandatory for a firm to claim GIPS compliance.
- B) Verification can be performed on specific, high-performing composites to attract clients.
- C) Verification is performed by an independent third party on a firm-wide basis and attests to compliance with GIPS requirements for composite construction and the firm's processes for presenting performance.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: C**

  **Explanation:**

  GIPS verification is voluntary but recommended. If a firm chooses to pursue verification, it must be performed by an independent third party. Verification applies to the entire firm's performance measurement practices and methods, not to selected composites. The verifier attests that the firm has complied with all GIPS requirements for composite construction on a firm-wide basis and that its processes and procedures are established to present performance in accordance with GIPS.

Janet, a CFA charterholder, is planning to leave her current employer, InvestPro, to start her own investment advisory firm. Before resigning, Janet uses her work computer during office hours to draft a business plan for her new firm and contacts several of InvestPro's clients to inform them of her new venture and solicit their business. Janet's actions are:

- A) Acceptable, as she is preparing for her future career.

- C) Acceptable if she does not take any client lists or proprietary information from InvestPro.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: B**

  **Explanation:**

  Standard IV(A) Loyalty requires members and candidates to act for the benefit of their employer and not deprive their employer of the advantage of their skills and abilities, divulge confidential information, or otherwise cause harm to their employer. Using employer's time and resources to prepare for a new competing business and soliciting employer's clients prior to resignation are violations of this Standard. [cite: 2733, 2735, 2744]

A firm manages several discretionary portfolios with a "Global Equity Growth" strategy. One of these portfolios significantly underperformed due to an isolated, client-specific restriction that is not representative of the typical strategy implementation. When constructing the "Global Equity Growth" composite for GIPS reporting, the firm should:

- A) Exclude the underperforming portfolio because its performance is not representative.
- B) Include the portfolio in the composite but add a footnote explaining the client-specific restriction and its impact.
- C) Include all fee-paying, discretionary portfolios managed according to the "Global Equity Growth" strategy in the composite. If the client restriction made the portfolio non-discretionary for the strategy, it could be excluded, but this must be defined ex-ante.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: C**

  **Explanation:**

  GIPS requires that composites include all actual fee-paying, discretionary portfolios managed according to that specific strategy or objective. A firm must define "discretion" for GIPS purposes. If a client-imposed restriction makes a portfolio non-discretionary (i.e., the manager cannot fully implement the intended strategy), that portfolio may be excluded from a composite. This determination and the definition of discretion should be made on an ex-ante (before performance is known) basis. Simply underperforming is not a valid reason for exclusion.

An investment firm has a policy of disseminating investment recommendations to its institutional clients 24 hours before releasing them to its retail clients. This policy is disclosed to all clients. This practice is:

- A) Acceptable, as institutional clients often pay higher fees and require more timely information.
- B) A violation of Standard III(B) Fair Dealing, as all clients should receive recommendations simultaneously.
- C) Acceptable if all clients are informed of this policy and different service levels are offered fairly.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: C**

  **Explanation:**

  Standard III(B) Fair Dealing requires members and candidates to deal fairly and objectively with all clients. "Fairly" does not necessarily mean "equally." Different service levels are permissible as long as they are disclosed to all clients and prospects, and all clients have the opportunity to pay for the premium service levels. If retail clients are not offered the option of receiving information earlier for a higher fee, this would likely be a violation. The key is disclosure and fair opportunity.

For GIPS purposes, "discretion" refers to the ability of the:

- B) Investment manager to implement its intended investment strategy.
- C) Firm to select which portfolios to include in a composite based on performance.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: B**

  **Explanation:**

  In the context of GIPS, discretion refers to the investment manager's ability to implement its intended investment strategy. If client-imposed restrictions prevent the manager from fully implementing the strategy for a particular portfolio, that portfolio may be deemed non-discretionary for that specific strategy's composite. Firms must document their policies for defining discretion. [cite: 3025, 3026]

Raj, a research analyst, is under pressure to issue a "buy" recommendation for a company whose CEO is a close friend of Raj's supervisor. Raj's independent analysis indicates the stock is overvalued. If Raj succumbs to the pressure and issues a "buy" recommendation without a reasonable basis, he would primarily violate:

- B) Standard V(A) Diligence and Reasonable Basis.
- C) Both A and B.

<details>

Alpha Investments claims GIPS compliance. When constructing its "U.S. Large Cap Value" composite, Alpha includes new portfolios in the composite starting from the first full month of performance after the portfolio comes under management and meets the composite definition. Terminated portfolios are removed from the composite after the last full month of performance. This treatment of new and terminated portfolios is:

- A) Consistent with GIPS requirements for composite construction.
- B) Inconsistent with GIPS, as new portfolios must be included from inception and terminated portfolios must remain in the composite through their termination date.
- C) Inconsistent with GIPS, as firms have discretion on when to include new portfolios and can choose to exclude terminated portfolios entirely.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: A**

  **Explanation:**

  GIPS standards provide specific rules for composite construction. Typically, new portfolios must be included in a composite on a timely basis, often interpreted as the first full performance period after the portfolio comes under management and meets the composite definition. Terminated portfolios must be included in the historical record of a composite up to the last full measurement period they were under management. Alpha's policy appears consistent with common GIPS guidance regarding the timing of portfolio inclusion and exclusion. [cite: 3003, 3004, 3018] *Self-correction: While generally true, specific GIPS editions might have nuanced timings. The core principle is timely and consistent inclusion/exclusion to avoid bias.*

Maria, CFA, is a supervisor at an investment firm. She discovers that one of her subordinates, John, has been consistently misallocating profitable trades to his personal account and less profitable ones to client accounts. Maria confronts John, who admits his wrongdoing. Maria documents the issue, verbally reprimands John, and warns him that further misconduct will result in termination. She does not report the issue to senior management or compliance, nor does she implement stricter oversight for John's trading activities, believing the verbal warning is sufficient. Maria has most likely violated:

- A) Only Standard IV(C) Responsibilities of Supervisors.
- B) Standard IV(C) Responsibilities of Supervisors and Standard I(A) Knowledge of the Law.
- C) Standard IV(C) Responsibilities of Supervisors, and John's actions may also constitute a violation of Standard I(D) Misconduct for John.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: B**

  **Explanation:**

  Maria violated Standard IV(C) Responsibilities of Supervisors by failing to take adequate steps to ensure John's compliance and by not implementing measures to prevent future violations after discovering the misconduct. A verbal warning alone for such serious misconduct is insufficient. She should have reported the violation to senior management or compliance and increased supervision. John's actions likely violate laws or regulations against fraudulent trading practices, and by not adequately addressing or reporting this, Maria may also be failing in her duty under Standard I(A) Knowledge of the Law to prevent or dissociate from violations. John's actions are also a clear violation of Standard I(D) Misconduct. [cite: 2471, 2536, 2761, 2762, 3110, 3111, 3128]

A GIPS-compliant firm manages a pooled fund (e.g., a mutual fund) that fits the definition of one of its existing composites. According to GIPS, how should the pooled fund be treated for composite purposes?

- A) The pooled fund can be shown as a separate GIPS-compliant report and does not need to be included in any composite.
- B) The pooled fund must be included in at least one of the firm's composites that shares the same investment strategy or objective.
- C) The firm has the discretion to include the pooled fund in a composite or present it separately, provided its performance is calculated according to GIPS.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: B**

  **Explanation:**

  A key concept in GIPS is comprehensive composite construction. If a firm manages a pooled fund (like a mutual fund) that meets the definition of one of its existing composites (i.e., has the same investment strategy or objective and is discretionary), that pooled fund *must* be included in that composite. This ensures fair representation and prevents firms from excluding certain vehicles from their composite track record. [cite: 3006, 3018]

An investment advisor recommends a complex structured product to a client with a stated objective of "capital preservation" and "low risk tolerance." The advisor fully discloses the risks associated with the product, and the client, after reviewing the disclosure, agrees to the investment. The product subsequently underperforms significantly. The advisor most likely violated:

- A) No Standard, as the risks were fully disclosed and the client consented.
- B) Standard III(C) Suitability, because the product was inappropriate for the client's stated objectives and risk tolerance, regardless of disclosure.
- C) Standard V(B) Communication with Clients and Prospective Clients, for not ensuring the client fully understood the risks.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: B**

  **Explanation:**

  While disclosure is important (Standard V(B) and Standard VI(A) Conflicts of Interest), it does not absolve an advisor from the responsibility of ensuring suitability under Standard III(C). Recommending a complex, potentially high-risk structured product to a client with objectives of capital preservation and low risk tolerance is a violation of suitability, even if the risks are disclosed. The investment must be appropriate for the client's situation and objectives. [cite: 2461, 2464, 2680, 3095]

Veritas Asset Management proudly states in its marketing materials: "Veritas Asset Management is GIPS Compliant." Upon review, it is found that Veritas only applies GIPS to its domestic equity composites, which represent 60% of its assets under management. Its fixed income and international equity composites, managed by a separate division in another city but under the Veritas brand, do not adhere to GIPS. This claim of GIPS compliance is:

- A) Acceptable, as GIPS compliance can be applied on a composite-by-composite basis.
- B) A violation of GIPS and likely Standard I(C) Misrepresentation, as GIPS compliance must be firm-wide.
- C) Acceptable if Veritas clearly discloses that compliance only applies to its domestic equity composites.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: B**

  **Explanation:**

  GIPS compliance must be on a firm-wide basis. The "firm" must be defined as the distinct business entity held out to clients. If Veritas Asset Management is the entity held out to clients, then all its operations, including all divisions managing assets under that brand, must comply with GIPS for the firm to claim compliance. Claiming GIPS compliance when it's only partially applied is misleading and violates GIPS principles. This would also likely constitute a misrepresentation under Standard I(C).
