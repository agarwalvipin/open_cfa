What is the primary purpose of the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS)?;To provide a standardized methodology for investment performance reporting, ensuring fair representation and full disclosure of investment performance.<br>GIPS aims to allow for meaningful comparisons of performance across firms and to instill investor confidence.[cite: 3003];Week5 Ethics GIPS
Who can claim compliance with GIPS?;Only investment management firms that actually manage assets can claim compliance with GIPS, and they must do so on a firm-wide basis. [cite: 3006]<br>Software developers or consultants cannot claim compliance but can state they endorse GIPS.[cite: 3007];Week5 Ethics GIPS
What are the eight sections of the GIPS Standards for Firms?;1. Fundamentals of Compliance 2. Input Data and Calculation Methodology 3. Composite and Pooled Fund Maintenance 4. Composite Time-Weighted Return Report 5. Composite Money-Weighted Return Report 6. Pooled Fund Time-Weighted Return Report 7. Pooled Fund Money-Weighted Return Report 8. GIPS Advertising Guidelines. [cite: 3009, 3010, 3011, 3013, 3014, 3019, 3023]<br>These sections provide the framework for GIPS compliance.;Week5 Ethics GIPS
What is a composite in the context of GIPS?;A composite is an aggregation of one or more portfolios managed according to a similar investment mandate, objective, or strategy. [cite: 3015, 3026]<br>It is a way to present a-weighted average performance for a particular investment strategy.;Week5 Ethics GIPS
According to GIPS, how should a "firm" be defined for compliance purposes?;The firm must be defined as the distinct business entity that is held out to clients or prospective clients as the investment firm. [cite: 3034]<br>If a firm has different geographic locations under the same brand, the definition should include all of them.[cite: 3035];Week5 Ethics GIPS
What is the concept of "discretion" in GIPS compliance?;Discretion refers to how a firm determines which portfolios it manages are included in a composite. [cite: 3036]<br>A portfolio might be deemed non-discretionary if client-imposed restrictions prevent the manager from implementing the intended strategy.[cite: 3037];Week5 Ethics GIPS
What does independent verification of GIPS compliance entail?;It's a process where a third party verifies that (1) the firm has complied with all GIPS requirements for composite construction on a firm-wide basis, and (2) the firm’s processes and procedures are established to present performance in accordance with GIPS. [cite: 3039, 3040, 3041]<br>Verification is optional but recommended.;Week5 Ethics GIPS
What is the goal of the "Identify" step in the CFA Institute Ethical Decision-Making Framework?;To identify relevant facts, stakeholders and duties owed, ethical principles involved, and potential conflicts of interest. [cite: 2383, 2385, 2386, 2387, 2388]<br>This is the first step in making an ethical decision.;Week5 Ethics Application
What is simple random sampling?;A method of selecting a sample where each item or person in the population has an equal chance of being included. [cite: 4178, 4182]<br>Often uses random number generators or tables.[cite: 4188];Week5 Quant Sampling
What is stratified random sampling?;A method where the population is divided into subgroups (strata) based on distinguishing characteristics, and random samples are taken from each stratum, often proportionally. [cite: 4190, 4191, 4192]<br>Ensures representation from each subgroup; often used in bond indexing.[cite: 4193];Week5 Quant Sampling
What is cluster sampling?;A method where the population is divided into subgroups (clusters), a random sample of clusters is selected, and all data (one-stage) or random samples (two-stage) from those selected clusters comprise the sample. [cite: 4205, 4207, 4208]<br>Assumes each cluster is representative of the population; can have greater sampling error than simple random sampling.[cite: 4210];Week5 Quant Sampling
What is convenience sampling?;A nonprobability sampling method where data is selected based on ease of access and availability. [cite: 4213, 4214]<br>Typically not random and may lead to greater sampling error.[cite: 4214];Week5 Quant Sampling
What is judgmental sampling?;A nonprobability sampling method where the researcher selects observations based on their experience and judgment. [cite: 4216, 4217]<br>Risk of researcher bias, but can be useful if judgment is sound.[cite: 4218];Week5 Quant Sampling
What does the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) state?;For simple random samples of size n (sufficiently large, usually n ≥ 30) from a population with mean μ and finite variance σ², the sampling distribution of the sample mean (x̄) will be approximately normal with mean μ and variance σ²/n. [cite: 4225, 4227, 4228, 4231, 4232]<br>This holds regardless of the population's distribution.;Week5 Quant CLT
What is the standard error of the sample mean when the population standard deviation (\(\sigma\)) is known?;\(\sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\)<br>It is the standard deviation of the distribution of the sample means.[cite: 4234];Week5 Quant CLT
What is the standard error of the sample mean when the population standard deviation (\(\sigma\)) is unknown?;\(s_{\bar{x}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\)<br>It is estimated using the sample standard deviation (s).[cite: 4235];Week5 Quant CLT
What is a hypothesis in hypothesis testing?;A statement about the value of a population parameter developed for the purpose of testing a theory or belief. [cite: 4281]<br>For example, stating that the population mean return is zero.;Week5 Quant HypothesisTesting
What is the null hypothesis (\(H_0\))?;The hypothesis that the researcher wants to reject. It is the hypothesis that is actually tested and always includes the "equal to" condition. [cite: 4288, 4291]<br>Example: \(H_0: \mu = \mu_0\).[cite: 4290];Week5 Quant HypothesisTesting
What is the alternative hypothesis (\(H_a\))?;The hypothesis that is concluded if there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. It's usually what the researcher is trying to assess. [cite: 4292, 4293]<br>Example: \(H_a: \mu \neq \mu_0\).[cite: 4295];Week5 Quant HypothesisTesting
What is a Type I error in hypothesis testing?;The rejection of the null hypothesis when it is actually true. [cite: 4319]<br>The probability of a Type I error is the significance level (α).[cite: 4321];Week5 Quant HypothesisTesting
What is a Type II error in hypothesis testing?;The failure to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false. [cite: 4320]<br>The probability of a Type II error is denoted by β.;Week5 Quant HypothesisTesting
What is the power of a test?;The probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. [cite: 4325]<br>Power = 1 - P(Type II error) = 1 - β.[cite: 4326];Week5 Quant HypothesisTesting
What is a p-value?;The smallest level of significance for which the null hypothesis can be rejected. It's the probability of obtaining a test statistic that would lead to rejecting H₀, assuming H₀ is true. [cite: 4345, 4346]<br>If p-value < α, reject H₀.;Week5 Quant HypothesisTesting
What is the general formula for a test statistic?;Test statistic = (Sample statistic - Hypothesized value) / Standard error of the sample statistic. [cite: 4309]<br>This scales the difference by the standard error.;Week5 Quant HypothesisTesting
What are the key steps in the hypothesis testing procedure?;1. State the hypothesis. 2. Select the appropriate test statistic. 3. Specify the level of significance. 4. State the decision rule. 5. Collect the sample and calculate sample statistics. 6. Make a decision regarding the hypothesis. 7. Make a decision based on the test results. [cite: 4286]<br>This structured approach ensures a logical testing process.;Week5 Quant HypothesisTesting
What is the significance level (α) of a hypothesis test?;The probability of making a Type I error (rejecting a true null hypothesis). [cite: 4321, 4322]<br>Commonly used levels are 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10.;Week5 Quant HypothesisTesting
When is a GIPS-compliant firm required to make a specific disclosure?;Only if the disclosure is applicable to that firm. [cite: 3020, 3021]<br>If a disclosure is not applicable, the firm is not required to include any statement regarding it.[cite: 3021];Week5 Ethics GIPS
What are the "Fundamentals of Compliance" under GIPS?;Key issues include: (a) proper definition of the firm, (b) providing GIPS-compliant reports to all clients and prospects, (c) adhering to all applicable laws and regulations, and (d) ensuring all presented information is truthful and not misleading. [cite: 3010]<br>These are foundational for claiming GIPS compliance.;Week5 Ethics GIPS
What is the importance of "Input Data and Calculation Methodology" under GIPS?;Input data must be consistent to ensure fair, full, and comparable investment performance presentations. [cite: 3011] GIPS mandates specific methodologies for portfolio and composite return calculations to ensure uniformity and comparability.[cite: 3012, 3013];Week5 Ethics GIPS
How does GIPS address "Composite and Pooled Fund Maintenance"?;It emphasizes creating meaningful, asset-weighted composites for fair presentation. [cite: 3014, 3015] Composite returns are asset-weighted averages of the returns of portfolios with similar strategies or objectives. [cite: 3016] Pooled funds fitting a composite's definition must be included.[cite: 3017];Week5 Ethics GIPS
What do the GIPS Advertising Guidelines cover?;They apply if an advertisement includes a claim of compliance with GIPS. [cite: 3023] If no GIPS compliance is mentioned, these specific guidelines do not apply.[cite: 3024];Week5 Ethics GIPS
What is the main goal of sampling in statistics?;To make inferences about a population parameter based on a sample statistic. [cite: 4282, 4285]<br>This involves estimating population characteristics from a smaller, manageable subset of data.;Week5 Quant Sampling
What is sampling error?;The difference between a sample statistic (e.g., sample mean) and the true population parameter (e.g., population mean) it is estimating, which arises because the sample is not perfectly representative of the population. [cite: 4181, 4209, 4211, 4214, 4218]<br>Nonprobability sampling generally leads to greater sampling error.[cite: 4181, 4214, 4218];Week5 Quant Sampling
Why is the Central Limit Theorem important in hypothesis testing?;It allows us to make inferences about the population mean using the sample mean, regardless of the population's distribution, provided the sample size is large enough (n≥30), as the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normal. [cite: 4226, 4227]<br>This normality facilitates the use of z-tests and t-tests.;Week5 Quant CLT
How does sample size affect the standard error of the sample mean?;As the sample size (n) increases, the standard error of the sample mean decreases. [cite: 4242, 4243]<br>A larger sample generally leads to a more precise estimate of the population mean.[cite: 4243];Week5 Quant CLT
Can you "accept" the null hypothesis?;No, it is statistically incorrect to "accept" the null hypothesis. [cite: 4338]<br>The decision is either to reject the null hypothesis or to fail to reject the null hypothesis.[cite: 4337];Week5 Quant HypothesisTesting
What is the relationship between the significance level (α) and the power of a test?;For a given sample size, decreasing the significance level (e.g., from 5% to 1%) increases the probability of a Type II error, thereby reducing the power of the test. [cite: 4334, 4335]<br>Conversely, increasing α increases the power but also the chance of a Type I error.;Week5 Quant HypothesisTesting
How can the power of a test be increased without increasing the significance level?;By increasing the sample size. [cite: 4336]<br>A larger sample provides more information, making it easier to detect a false null hypothesis.;Week5 Quant HypothesisTesting
