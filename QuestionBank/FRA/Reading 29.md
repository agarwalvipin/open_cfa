Which of the following is the *best* example of an identifiable intangible asset?
- A) Goodwill acquired in a business combination.
- B) A patent purchased from another company.
- C) Brand recognition developed through successful advertising campaigns.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* [cite_start]**B is correct.** An identifiable intangible asset is one that can be acquired separately or arises from contractual or legal rights. [cite: 621] [cite_start]A purchased patent fits this definition perfectly. [cite: 622]
* [cite_start]**A is incorrect.** Goodwill is the primary example of an unidentifiable intangible asset because it cannot be acquired separately from the business itself. [cite: 623]
* [cite_start]**C is incorrect.** Costs to create intangible assets internally, such as advertising and promotion costs, are generally expensed as incurred and are not reported on the balance sheet. [cite: 626]

Goodwill is *most likely* created on the balance sheet when:
- A) a company's brand becomes globally recognized.
- B) a company acquires another business for more than the fair value of its identifiable net assets.
- C) a company successfully defends a key patent in court.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* [cite_start]**B is correct.** Goodwill is specifically defined as the amount by which the purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the acquired companyâ€™s identifiable net assets (assets minus liabilities). [cite: 634]
* [cite_start]**A is incorrect.** Internally generated goodwill, such as that arising from brand recognition or customer loyalty, is not capitalized on the balance sheet. [cite: 636]
* **C is incorrect.** The costs associated with defending a patent are typically expensed and do not create goodwill. [cite_start]Goodwill arises only from a business combination. [cite: 634]

When a company issues a bond at a discount, the carrying value of the liability on the balance sheet will:
- A) increase over time.
- B) decrease over time.
- C) remain constant over time.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

* **A is correct.** When a bond is issued at a discount, the discount is amortized over the life of the bond. [cite_start]This amortization increases interest expense and also increases the carrying value of the liability on the balance sheet, moving it towards its face value at maturity. [cite: 666, 668, 720]
* [cite_start]**B is incorrect.** The liability value decreases over time when a bond is issued at a premium. [cite: 720]
* **C is incorrect.** The carrying value only remains constant if the bond is issued at par value and there are no principal repayments.

A vertical common-size balance sheet expresses each balance sheet item as a percentage of:
- A) total equity.

- C) total assets.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

* [cite_start]**C is correct.** In a vertical common-size balance sheet, all accounts are expressed as a percentage of total assets. [cite: 683, 722] [cite_start]This standardizes the balance sheet and eliminates the effect of size, allowing for better comparability over time or across different companies. [cite: 683]
* **A is incorrect.** Total equity is the denominator for some ratios (like debt-to-equity) but not for the common-size balance sheet itself.
* **B is incorrect.** Total liabilities is a component of the balance sheet, not the base for the common-size version.

## ðŸŸ¡ Q18 â€“ Analyzing Balance Sheets - Non-Current Liabilities
A firm issues a 5-year, $1,000 face value bond with a 6% coupon, paid annually, when market interest rates are 5%. The bond is issued at a premium. On the firm's balance sheet, the carrying value of this bond liability will:
- A) increase each year and equal $1,000 at maturity.
- B) decrease each year and equal $1,000 at maturity.
- C) remain constant at the issue price throughout its life.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>
<p>
<strong>Correct Answer: B</strong>
<p>
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
<ul>
<li><b>B is correct.</b> When a bond is issued at a premium, the liability is initially recorded at a value greater than its face value. This premium is amortized over the life of the bond, which reduces the interest expense and decreases the carrying value of the liability each year. [cite_start]At maturity, the carrying value will equal the face value of $1,000. [cite: 666, 720]

An analyst is comparing two firms. Firm A reports under U.S. GAAP and Firm B reports under IFRS. Both firms purchase the same non-callable debt security and classify it based on an intent to hold it for several years but sell it before maturity. If the security's fair value increases, which statement is *most* accurate?
- A) Both firms will report the unrealized gain in Other Comprehensive Income.
- B) Firm A reports the gain in OCI, while Firm B reports it in the income statement.
- C) Firm A reports the gain in the income statement, while Firm B reports it in OCI.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

* **A is correct.** The described intent corresponds to the "Available-for-Sale" (AFS) classification under U.S. GAAP and the "Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income" (FVOCI) classification under IFRS.
    * [cite_start]Under U.S. GAAP, unrealized gains and losses on AFS securities are reported in OCI. [cite: 714]
    * [cite_start]Under IFRS, debt securities held with the intent to both collect payments and sell are classified at FVOCI, with unrealized gains and losses also reported in OCI. [cite: 659, 660]
    * Therefore, the accounting treatment of the unrealized gain is similar for both firms in this specific scenario.

An analyst decides to adjust a company's financial statements for comparability by removing goodwill of $50 million from total assets of $400 million and total equity of $200 million. The company's total debt is $150 million. What is the effect of this adjustment on the debt-to-assets and debt-to-equity ratios?

| | Debt-to-Assets | Debt-to-Equity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A. | Increases | Increases |
| B. | Decreases | Increases |
| C. | Increases | Decreases |

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

1.  **Original Ratios:**
    * Debt-to-Assets = $150M / $400M = 0.375
    * Debt-to-Equity = $150M / $200M = 0.75
2.  [cite_start]**Adjusted Values:** Analysts often eliminate goodwill from balance sheets to improve comparability. [cite: 642]
    * Adjusted Assets = $400M - $50M = $350M
    * Adjusted Equity = $200M - $50M = $150M
    * Debt remains unchanged at $150M.
3.  **Adjusted Ratios:**
    * Adjusted Debt-to-Assets = $150M / $350M = 0.429
    * Adjusted Debt-to-Equity = $150M / $150M = 1.00
4.  **Comparison:**
    * The debt-to-assets ratio increases from 0.375 to 0.429.
    * The debt-to-equity ratio increases from 0.75 to 1.00.
    * Both ratios increase because removing goodwill reduces the denominator of both ratios while leaving the numerator (debt) unchanged.

## ðŸ”´ Q23 â€“ Analyzing Balance Sheets - Intangible Assets (Revaluation)
An IFRS-reporting company has a purchased identifiable intangible asset with a carrying value of â‚¬100 million. The company uses the revaluation model. At year-end, an active market indicates the asset's fair value is â‚¬120 million. The *most likely* impact on the financial statements in the year of revaluation is:
- A) a gain of â‚¬20 million is reported on the income statement.
- B) total assets increase by â‚¬20 million, and a revaluation surplus of â‚¬20 million is reported in OCI.
- C) the asset is written up to â‚¬120 million, but no gain is recognized until the asset is sold.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>
<p>
<strong>Correct Answer: B</strong>
<p>
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
<ul>
[cite_start]<li><b>B is correct.</b> Under IFRS, companies can use the revaluation model for identifiable intangible assets if an active market exists. [cite: 624] [cite_start]When an asset is revalued upward, the increase in its carrying value is reported as a revaluation surplus in other comprehensive income (OCI), which increases total equity. [cite: 1105, 1170] Total assets increase by the same amount.
<li><b>A is incorrect.</b> Upward revaluations are generally recognized in OCI, not the income statement, unless they are reversing a previously recognized impairment loss.
<li><b>C is incorrect.</b> The revaluation is recognized in the period it occurs, not deferred until sale.
</ul>

## ðŸ”´ Q24 â€“ Analyzing Balance Sheets - Ratio Interpretation
An analyst reviews the following ratio trends for a company over three years:
- Current ratio has declined from 2.5 to 1.5.
- Quick ratio has remained stable at 1.0.
- Debt-to-equity ratio has increased from 0.5 to 1.2.

This combination of trends *most likely* suggests that the company is:
- A) improving its inventory management and reducing its financial risk.
- B) facing liquidity pressure due to a buildup of inventory, financed by increasing debt.
- C) selling off inventory to pay down debt, improving its solvency.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>
<p>
<strong>Correct Answer: B</strong>
<p>
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
<ul>
[cite_start]<li><b>B is correct.</b> The declining current ratio indicates worsening liquidity. [cite: 686] Because the quick ratio (which excludes inventory) is stable, the decline in the current ratio must be driven by a significant increase in inventory relative to other current assets and liabilities. The increasing debt-to-equity ratio shows a growing reliance on debt financing, which could be used to fund this inventory buildup. This combination points to liquidity pressure and increasing financial risk.
<li><b>A is incorrect.</b> A buildup of inventory indicates worsening, not improving, inventory management, and increasing leverage indicates higher, not lower, financial risk.
<li><b>C is incorrect.</b> If the company were selling off inventory, the current ratio would not be declining due to inventory buildup, and if it were paying down debt, the debt-to-equity ratio would be decreasing, not increasing.
</ul>

## ðŸ”´ Q25 â€“ Analyzing Balance Sheets - Non-Current Liabilities (Fair Value Option)
Under IFRS, a company issues bonds and elects to report them at fair value. In the subsequent period, the company's own credit risk worsens, leading to a decrease in the fair value of its bonds. The company will *most likely* recognize:
- A) a loss in the income statement.
- B) a gain in the income statement.
- C) a gain in other comprehensive income.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>
<p>
<strong>Correct Answer: C</strong>
<p>
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
<ul>
<li><b>C is correct.</b> When financial liabilities are reported at fair value, changes in fair value are typically recognized in profit or loss. However, there is a specific rule for changes in fair value that are attributable to changes in the liability's own credit risk. Under IFRS, the portion of the change in a liability's fair value that results from a change in its own credit risk is recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI), not the income statement. [cite_start]A decrease in the fair value of a liability is a gain for the issuer. [cite: 669]
<li><b>A is incorrect.</b> A decrease in the fair value of a liability results in a gain, not a loss.
<li><b>B is incorrect.</b> While changes in fair value for liabilities often go to the income statement, the portion related to the entity's own credit risk is specifically directed to OCI under IFRS to prevent companies from profiting on their own deteriorating creditworthiness.
</ul>
