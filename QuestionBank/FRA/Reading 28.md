What is the diluted earnings per share (EPS) for Tech Innovators Inc. for 2024?

  - A) $4.03
  - B) $4.21
  - C) $4.55

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

  * **A is correct.** The calculation requires determining the impact of both the stock options and the convertible bonds.

    1.  **Calculate Basic EPS:**

          * Weighted-average common shares (WACS): (1,000,000 shares Ã— 12/12) + (200,000 shares Ã— 6/12) = 1,000,000 + 100,000 = 1,100,000 shares.
          * Basic EPS = $5,000,000 / 1,100,000 = $4.55.

    2.  **Calculate incremental shares from options (Treasury Stock Method):**

          * Proceeds from exercise = 50,000 options Ã— $25 = $1,250,000.
          * Shares repurchased = $1,250,000 / $40 (avg. market price) = 31,250 shares.
          * Net new shares issued = 50,000 - 31,250 = 18,750 shares.
          * EPS effect of options = $0 / 18,750 = $0 (most dilutive).

    3.  **Calculate the per-share effect of convertible bonds:**

          * Interest expense = 10,000 bonds Ã— $1,000 par Ã— 8% = $800,000.
          * After-tax interest savings = $800,000 Ã— (1 - 0.30) = $560,000.
          * Shares from conversion = 10,000 bonds Ã— 20 shares/bond = 200,000 shares.
          * Per-share effect = $560,000 / 200,000 shares = $2.80.

    4.  **Determine Dilution:** Both options ($0) and bonds ($2.80) have a per-share effect less than basic EPS ($4.55), so both are dilutive. We include them in the calculation.

    5.  **Calculate Diluted EPS:**

          * Numerator = Net Income + After-tax interest savings = $5,000,000 + $560,000 = $5,560,000.
          * Denominator = WACS + Shares from options + Shares from bonds = 1,100,000 + 18,750 + 200,000 = 1,318,750 shares.
          * Diluted EPS = $5,560,000 / 1,318,750 = **$4.21**.

    *Whoops, I made a calculation error in my explanation, let me re-calculate and provide the correct steps.*

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** The calculation requires determining the impact of both the stock options and the convertible bonds.

    1.  **Calculate Basic EPS:**

          * Weighted-average common shares (WACS): (1,000,000 shares Ã— 12/12) + (200,000 shares Ã— 6/12) = 1,000,000 + 100,000 = 1,100,000 shares.
          * Basic EPS = $5,000,000 / 1,100,000 = $4.55.

    2.  **Calculate incremental shares from options (Treasury Stock Method):**

          * Proceeds from exercise = 50,000 options Ã— $25 = $1,250,000.
          * Shares repurchased = $1,250,000 / $40 (avg. market price) = 31,250 shares.
          * Net new shares issued = 50,000 - 31,250 = 18,750 shares.
          * The options are dilutive because the exercise price ($25) is less than the average market price ($40).

    3.  **Calculate the per-share effect of convertible bonds:**

          * Interest expense = 10,000 bonds Ã— $1,000 par Ã— 8% = $800,000.
          * After-tax interest savings = $800,000 Ã— (1 - 0.30) = $560,000.
          * Shares from conversion = 10,000 bonds Ã— 20 shares/bond = 200,000 shares.
          * The bonds are dilutive because their per-share effect ($560,000 / 200,000 = $2.80) is less than basic EPS.

    4.  **Calculate Diluted EPS:**

          * Numerator = Net Income + After-tax interest savings from bonds = $5,000,000 + $560,000 = $5,560,000.
          * Denominator = WACS + Shares from options + Shares from bonds = 1,100,000 + 18,750 + 200,000 = 1,318,750 shares.
          * Diluted EPS = $5,560,000 / 1,318,750 = **$4.21**.

The basic earnings per share (EPS) for Tech Innovators Inc. is *closest* to:

  - A) $5.00
  - B) $4.55
  - C) $4.17

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** Basic EPS is calculated as (Net Income - Preferred Dividends) / Weighted-Average Common Shares.
      * Net Income = $5,000,000.
      * There are no preferred dividends mentioned.
      * Weighted-average common shares (WACS) = (1,000,000 shares Ã— 12/12) + (200,000 shares Ã— 6/12) = 1,000,000 + 100,000 = 1,100,000 shares.
      * Basic EPS = $5,000,000 / 1,100,000 = **$4.55**.
  * **A is incorrect.** This result is calculated by incorrectly dividing net income by the beginning number of shares ($5,000,000 / 1,000,000).
  * **C is incorrect.** This result is calculated by incorrectly dividing net income by the ending number of shares ($5,000,000 / 1,200,000).

</details>

Assume, for this question only, that Tech Innovators also had 10,000 shares of 6% convertible preferred stock outstanding for the entire year. Each preferred share pays a $6 annual dividend and is convertible into 1.2 common shares. In calculating diluted EPS, the effect of this convertible preferred stock would be:

  - A) Dilutive.
  - B) Antidilutive.
  - C) Neither dilutive nor antidilutive.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** A security is antidilutive if its inclusion in the EPS calculation would increase EPS. To check, we calculate its per-share effect.
      * Income effect (numerator): The preferred dividends saved = 10,000 shares Ã— $6/share = $60,000.
      * Share effect (denominator): New common shares issued = 10,000 shares Ã— 1.2 = 12,000 shares.
      * Per-share effect = $60,000 / 12,000 shares = $5.00.
      * Since this per-share effect of $5.00 is **greater than** the basic EPS of $4.55, the security is antidilutive and would be excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.
  * **A is incorrect.** The security would only be dilutive if its per-share effect was less than basic EPS.

BuildCo is a construction company that specializes in long-term projects. In 2024, it signed a three-year contract for $15 million to build a new office complex. The total estimated cost of the project is $12 million. BuildCo recognizes revenue using the percentage-of-completion method. Financial data for the project is as follows:

| Year | Costs Incurred | Estimated Costs to Complete | Billings to Customer | Cash Collected |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2024 | $3,000,000 | $9,000,000 | $2,500,000 | $2,000,000 |

Additionally, in 2024, BuildCo decided to sell its separate real estate management division. The division was sold for a loss of $500,000 (net of tax) and had generated income of $200,000 (net of tax) during 2024 before being sold. BuildCo's income from continuing operations before tax was $10 million, and its tax rate is 25%.

How much revenue should BuildCo recognize from the long-term contract in 2024?

  - A) $2,500,000
  - B) $3,750,000
  - C) $3,000,000

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** Under the percentage-of-completion method, revenue is recognized based on the proportion of work completed.
      * Total Estimated Cost = $3,000,000 (incurred) + $9,000,000 (to complete) = $12,000,000.
      * Percentage Complete = Costs Incurred / Total Estimated Cost = $3,000,000 / $12,000,000 = 25%.
      * Revenue Recognized in 2024 = Total Contract Revenue Ã— Percentage Complete = $15,000,000 Ã— 25% = **$3,750,000**.
  * **A is incorrect.** This is the amount billed to the customer, which does not determine revenue recognition under this method.
  * **C is incorrect.** This is the cost incurred, not the revenue recognized.

How should the sale of the real estate management division be reported on BuildCo's 2024 income statement?

  - A) As an unusual or infrequent item within continuing operations.

  - C) As a prior-period adjustment to retained earnings.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** The sale of a separate business division qualifies as a discontinued operation. The results of discontinued operations are reported separately on the income statement, net of applicable taxes, after the line for income from continuing operations.
  * **A is incorrect.** Unusual or infrequent items are reported before tax within income from continuing operations. The sale of an entire division is a more significant event that qualifies for treatment as a discontinued operation.
  * **C is incorrect.** Prior-period adjustments are used to correct errors, not to report discontinued operations.

  - C) $7,700,000

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

  * **A is correct.**
    1.  Income from continuing operations before tax = $10,000,000.
    2.  Tax on continuing operations = $10,000,000 Ã— 25% = $2,500,000.
    3.  Income from continuing operations (after tax) = $10,000,000 - $2,500,000 = $7,500,000.
    4.  Net impact of discontinued operations = Income from division ($200,000) - Loss on sale ($500,000) = -$300,000. This amount is already net of tax.
    5.  Net Income = Income from continuing operations + Discontinued operations = $7,500,000 - $300,000 = **$7,200,000**.

To make a more valid comparison of the two companies' operating performance, what adjustment should the analyst *most likely* make?

  - A) Add capitalized development costs to Alpha Corp's revenue.
  - B) Add capitalized development costs back to Beta Tech's R\&D expense.
  - C) Add capitalized development costs to Alpha Corp's R\&D expense and subtract them from its cash flow from investing.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  * **C is correct.** To improve comparability, an analyst should treat R\&D consistently. Since Beta Tech expenses all R\&D, the appropriate adjustment is to treat Alpha Corp's R\&D in the same way. This involves adding the capitalized amount ($30 million) to Alpha Corp's reported R\&D expense. This would decrease Alpha Corp's reported operating income, making the comparison with Beta Tech more meaningful. Capitalizing development costs treats them as an investing cash outflow, so an analyst would reclassify this from investing to operating cash flow (by adding it back to CFO and subtracting from CFI). The question focuses on the income statement adjustment, which is adding the cost to R\&D expense.
  * **A is incorrect.** Capitalized costs are not revenue.
  * **B is incorrect.** The adjustment should be made to Alpha Corp, the company that capitalizes, not Beta Tech.

  - A) Period costs.
  - B) Immediate recognition.
  - C) Matching principle.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  * **C is correct.** The matching principle dictates that expenses incurred to generate revenue should be recognized in the same period as the revenue. By depreciating the machine over its useful life, the company is systematically allocating its cost to the periods in which the machine is expected to help generate revenue.
  * **A is incorrect.** Period costs (like SG\&A) are expensed in the period in which they are incurred because they are not directly tied to revenue generation.
  * **B is incorrect.** Immediate recognition applies to costs that have no future benefit, unlike a productive asset.

A company voluntarily changes its inventory accounting method from weighted-average cost to FIFO. To account for this change, the company should *most likely*:

  - A) Apply the new method prospectively to future inventory purchases.
  - B) Restate the financial statements of all prior periods presented in the current report as if the new method had been used all along.
  - C) Report the cumulative effect of the change as a non-recurring item in the current period's income statement.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** A change in an accounting principle, such as the inventory valuation method, generally requires retrospective application. This means prior-period statements that are presented for comparative purposes must be restated to reflect the change, enhancing comparability. The cumulative effect of the change on periods before those presented is recorded as an adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings.
  * **A is incorrect.** Prospective application is used for changes in accounting estimates, not principles.
  * **C is incorrect.** Reporting the cumulative effect on the income statement was the practice under older standards but is no longer the generally accepted method.

A company has 100,000 stock options outstanding with an exercise price of $20. The average market price of the company's stock for the year was $25. How many incremental shares would be added to the denominator of the diluted EPS calculation?

  - A) 100,000
  - B) 80,000
  - C) 20,000

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  * **C is correct.** The treasury stock method is used to calculate the net increase in shares.
    1.  Assume the options are exercised: Proceeds = 100,000 options Ã— $20/share = $2,000,000.
    2.  Assume the company uses these proceeds to repurchase its own stock at the average market price: Shares repurchased = $2,000,000 / $25/share = 80,000 shares.
    3.  Net increase in shares = Shares issued (100,000) - Shares repurchased (80,000) = **20,000** incremental shares.

A loss from the write-down of inventory due to a sudden drop in demand would *most likely* be classified on the income statement as:

  - A) A discontinued operation.
  - B) An unusual or infrequent item.
  - C) A change in accounting estimate.

</details>

An analyst notices that a company's revenue increased significantly in the last quarter of the year, while its accounts receivable also grew at a much faster rate than revenue. This observation could be an indicator of:

  - A) The successful launch of a new product.
  - B) Aggressive revenue recognition practices, such as channel stuffing.
  - C) A shift to a cash-only sales policy.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** Channel stuffing involves inducing distributors to buy more inventory than they can promptly resell, often by offering generous payment terms. This boosts revenue in the short term but also inflates accounts receivable. A disproportionate increase in receivables relative to sales is a classic red flag for this practice.
  * **A is incorrect.** While a successful product launch would increase revenue, it wouldn't necessarily cause receivables to grow much faster than sales.
  * **C is incorrect.** A cash-only sales policy would cause accounts receivable to decrease, not increase.

  * tags: \[Capitalization vs Expensing]

</details>

Compared to a company that expenses a cost in the current period, a company that capitalizes the same cost will report:

  - A) Higher net income in the first year and lower cash flow from operations.
  - B) Lower net income in the first year and higher cash flow from operations.
  - C) Higher net income in the first year and higher cash flow from operations.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

  * **A is correct.**
      * **Net Income:** Capitalizing a cost avoids a large expense in the first year (only a portion is recognized as depreciation/amortization), leading to higher net income compared to expensing the full cost immediately.
      * **Cash Flow:** Capitalizing a cost classifies the cash outflow as an investing activity. Expensing classifies it as an operating activity. Therefore, capitalizing results in higher reported net income but lower cash flow from investing, and consequently higher cash flow from operations, all else equal. *Correction:* Expensing a cost reduces net income, which is the starting point for CFO. Capitalizing the cost means the cash outflow is classified under CFI. Thus, capitalizing results in higher CFO. Let me re-evaluate the answer.
      * **Net Income:** Capitalizing results in higher NI in the first year.
      * **Cash Flow from Operations (CFO):** Expensing the cost means it flows through the income statement, reducing net income, which is the start of the indirect CFO calculation. The cash outflow is an operating outflow. Capitalizing means the cost does not hit the income statement (except for depreciation). The cash outflow is classified as a cash flow from investing (CFI). Therefore, capitalizing leads to higher reported CFO. The initial answer choice 'A' states *lower* cash flow from operations which is incorrect. Let's re-examine the choices.
      * Choice A says higher NI (correct) and lower CFO (incorrect).
      * Choice C says higher NI (correct) and higher CFO (correct).
        Let's re-verify. If a company spends $100, Company E (expenses) has a $100 operating cash outflow. Company C (capitalizes) has a $100 investing cash outflow. Therefore, Company C has a higher CFO (by $100) than Company E. So, capitalizing leads to higher NI and higher CFO in the first year.

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  * **C is correct.**
      * **Net Income:** When a cost is capitalized, it is recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and is not immediately expensed on the income statement (only a small portion might be recognized as depreciation). Expensing the cost puts the full amount on the income statement. Therefore, capitalizing results in higher net income in the first period.
      * **Cash Flow from Operations (CFO):** A capitalized cost is treated as a cash outflow for investing (CFI). An expensed cost is treated as a cash outflow for operations (CFO). Therefore, the company that capitalizes the cost will report a higher CFO.

A construction firm enters a $10 million contract and expects total costs of $8 million. The outcome of the project cannot be reliably estimated. In the first year, the firm incurs $2 million in costs. Under IFRS, the amount of revenue the firm should recognize in the first year is:

  - A) $0
  - B) $2,000,000
  - C) $2,500,000

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** Under IFRS, if the outcome of a long-term contract cannot be reliably estimated, revenue should be recognized only to the extent of the contract costs incurred that are probable to be recovered. Since $2 million in costs were incurred, the firm should recognize $2 million in revenue, resulting in zero profit for the period. The costs are expensed as incurred, matching the revenue.
  * **A is incorrect.** Revenue is recognized to the extent of costs incurred.
  * **C is incorrect.** This would be the revenue recognized if the percentage-of-completion method were used ($10M \* ($2M / $8M)). However, that method is not appropriate when the outcome cannot be reliably estimated.

For the purpose of calculating diluted EPS, a company's convertible bonds are considered dilutive if:

  - A) Their conversion would increase the numerator of the EPS calculation.
  - B) The company's stock price is trading above the conversion price.
  - C) The per-share impact of their conversion is less than the company's basic EPS.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  * **C is correct.** The test for whether a convertible security is dilutive is to calculate its per-share impact: (After-tax interest savings) / (Number of common shares from conversion). If this amount is less than the basic EPS, the security is dilutive and should be included in the diluted EPS calculation.
  * **A is incorrect.** While conversion does increase the numerator (by adding back after-tax interest), this is not the test for dilution. The denominator also increases, and the net effect is what matters.
  * **B is incorrect.** While a high stock price makes conversion more likely, the official test for dilution compares the security's per-share impact to basic EPS.

An analyst observes the following trends in a company's vertical common-size income statement over three years: Gross profit margin is stable, but the operating profit margin is declining. This pattern *most likely* indicates:

  - A) A decline in the company's pricing power.
  - B) A loss of control over selling, general, and administrative (SG\&A) expenses.
  - C) An increase in the company's effective tax rate.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** The gross profit margin (Gross Profit / Revenue) reflects control over direct production costs (COGS). The operating profit margin (Operating Income / Revenue) reflects control over both COGS and operating expenses (like SG\&A). If the gross margin is stable, it means the relationship between price and COGS is stable. If the operating margin is declining simultaneously, the cause must be operating expenses (the items between gross profit and operating income) growing as a percentage of sales.
  * **A is incorrect.** A decline in pricing power would cause the gross profit margin to fall.
  * **C is incorrect.** An increase in the tax rate would affect the net profit margin, not the operating profit margin.

A company that ships goods to customers on consignment but recognizes revenue at the time of shipment, rather than when the goods are ultimately sold by the consignee, is demonstrating:

  - A) Conservative revenue recognition.
  - B) A low quality of earnings.
  - C) Compliance with the matching principle.

<details>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** In a consignment arrangement, control of the goods has not yet transferred to the end customer. Recognizing revenue prematurely (at the time of shipment to the consignee) is an example of aggressive revenue recognition. This practice inflates revenue and earnings in the current period, which is indicative of a low quality of earnings because the reported earnings are not sustainable and do not accurately reflect the company's performance.
  * **A is incorrect.** This is an example of aggressive, not conservative, revenue recognition.
  * **C is incorrect.** This practice violates the revenue recognition principle, not the matching principle (which relates expenses to revenues).

An analyst concerned about the quality of Global Exports' earnings should be aware that recognizing revenue from this bill-and-hold transaction in 2024 could:

  - A) Be appropriate, provided the customer has a substantive reason for the request and has accepted the asset.
  - B) Be inappropriate under all circumstances, as revenue can only be recognized upon shipment.
  - C) Be a sign of conservative accounting practices.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

  * **A is correct.** While bill-and-hold arrangements can be used to aggressively recognize revenue, they are permitted under IFRS and U.S. GAAP if strict criteria are met. The key is whether control has truly transferred to the buyer. If the customer has requested the arrangement for a substantive reason (e.g., their site isn't ready), the product is specifically identified as belonging to them, and it's ready for delivery, then control may have passed, and revenue recognition could be appropriate. An analyst must investigate the details to assess the quality of earnings.
  * **B is incorrect.** Shipment is a common indicator of transfer of control, but it is not the only one. Control can transfer before shipment in a valid bill-and-hold sale.
  * **C is incorrect.** Recognizing revenue as early as possible is a characteristic of aggressive, not conservative, accounting.

The diluted EPS for Phoenix Corp. is *closest* to:

  - A) $5.29
  - B) $5.35
  - C) $5.75

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

  * **A is correct.** We must check if the convertible preferred stock and warrants are dilutive and then include them in the calculation if they are.
    1.  **Check Preferred Stock:**

          * Per-share effect = Preferred Dividends / Shares from conversion = $500,000 / (100,000 Ã— 2) = $500,000 / 200,000 = $2.50.
          * Since $2.50 is less than Basic EPS ($5.75), the preferred stock is dilutive.

    2.  **Check Warrants (Treasury Stock Method):**

          * Exercise price ($40) is less than market price ($50), so they are dilutive.
          * Proceeds from exercise = 300,000 warrants Ã— $40 = $12,000,000.
          * Shares repurchased = $12,000,000 / $50 = 240,000 shares.
          * Net new shares = 300,000 - 240,000 = 60,000 shares.
          * Per-share effect is $0 (no income effect).

    3.  **Calculate Diluted EPS:** Start with the most dilutive security (warrants) and add the next (preferred stock).

          * Numerator = Net Income = $12,000,000 (We use Net Income because we add back the preferred dividends which were subtracted for Basic EPS, but not for diluted when conversion is assumed).
          * Denominator = Basic WACS + Shares from warrants + Shares from preferred conversion = 2,000,000 + 60,000 + 200,000 = 2,260,000.
          * Diluted EPS = $12,000,000 / 2,260,000 = **$5.31**. The closest answer is $5.29. *Let me recheck*. Ah, the numerator for Basic EPS is `Net Income - Preferred Dividends`. When we assume conversion of preferred stock, we add the preferred dividends back. So, the numerator becomes the original Net Income. The calculation is correct. The discrepancy might be a rounding choice in the question. Let's stick with the calculated answer. $5.31 is closest to $5.29.

  * **B is correct.** Administrative costs like executive salaries are not directly tied to the production of a specific product. Therefore, they are treated as period costs and are expensed on the income statement in the period they are incurred.
  * **A is incorrect.** Product costs (direct materials, direct labor, manufacturing overhead) are included in inventory and are expensed as COGS when the product is sold.
  * **C is incorrect.** Salaries are operating expenses, not capital expenditures.

An analyst prepares a vertical common-size income statement to *most effectively*:

  - A) Compare the growth rate of revenue to the growth rate of net income over time.
  - B) Analyze the contribution of each expense category to the company's profitability for a single period.
  - C) Determine the absolute dollar change in operating expenses between two periods.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** By expressing all income statement items as a percentage of revenue for a given year, a vertical common-size statement allows an analyst to see the relative size of each expense and its impact on profit margins. It highlights the company's cost structure.
  * **A is incorrect.** This is best done using horizontal analysis or trend analysis, where line items are compared over several periods.
  * **C is incorrect.** A common-size statement uses percentages, not absolute dollar amounts.

A company changes the estimated useful life of its machinery from 10 years to 8 years due to new information about wear and tear. This change should be accounted for:

  - A) Retrospectively, by restating all prior financial statements.
  - B) Prospectively, by applying the change to the current and future periods.

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** A change in an accounting estimate, such as the useful life or salvage value of an asset, is accounted for prospectively. The change affects the depreciation expense in the current period and future periods, but prior periods are not restated.
  * **A and C are incorrect.** Retrospective application and cumulative effect adjustments are used for changes in accounting principles, not changes in estimates.

</details>

In the first year a cost is incurred, a company that capitalizes the cost instead of expensing it will report a higher:

  - A) Debt-to-equity ratio.
  - B) Return on assets (ROA).
  - C) Cash flow from operations (CFO).

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  * **C is correct.** Capitalizing a cost classifies it as an investing cash outflow, while expensing it classifies it as an operating cash outflow. Therefore, capitalizing a cost leads to a higher reported CFO in the period the cost is incurred.
  * **A is incorrect.** Capitalizing a cost increases assets and equity (via higher net income/retained earnings), likely decreasing or having a mixed effect on the debt-to-equity ratio, not increasing it.
  * **B is incorrect.** Return on assets (Net Income / Average Total Assets) would be lower. Net income is higher, but assets increase by an even larger amount (the full capitalized cost vs. the increase in retained earnings, which is net of tax), leading to a lower ROA in the first year.

Stock options are considered antidilutive and are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS when their exercise price is:

  - A) Less than the average market price of the stock.
  - B) Greater than the average market price of the stock.
  - C) Equal to the average market price of the stock.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** The treasury stock method assumes that the proceeds from the exercise of options would be used to buy back shares at the average market price. If the exercise price is greater than the average market price, the options are "out-of-the-money," and it is assumed they would not be exercised. Including them would theoretically result in a net buyback of shares, decreasing the share count and increasing EPS. Therefore, they are antidilutive and are ignored.
  * **A is incorrect.** If the exercise price is less than the average market price, the options are "in-the-money" and are dilutive.
  * **C is incorrect.** If the prices are equal, there is no net effect on the number of shares, so they are neither dilutive nor antidilutive.

  - A) As a component of discontinued operations, net of tax.
  - B) As a separate line item within income from continuing operations, shown pre-tax.
  - C) As an adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** The sale of a single asset like a warehouse, which does not represent a strategic shift or the disposal of a major business line, does not qualify as a discontinued operation. It would be treated as an unusual or infrequent item. Under U.S. GAAP, such items are presented pre-tax as a separate line item within income from continuing operations.
  * **A is incorrect.** This treatment is for discontinued operations.

    </details>

A mobile phone company sells a handset and a two-year service plan for a single bundled price of $1,200. The company determines that the standalone selling price of the handset is $800 and the standalone price of the service is $30 per month ($720 over two years). Under IFRS 15, how much revenue should the company recognize at the point of sale (when the customer receives the phone)?

  - A) $1,200
  - B) $800
  - C) $667

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  * **C is correct.** When a contract has multiple performance obligations (the handset and the service plan), the transaction price must be allocated to each obligation based on its standalone selling price.

    1.  **Total Standalone Price:** $800 (handset) + $720 (service) = $1,520.
    2.  **Allocation Percentage for Handset:** $800 / $1,520 = 52.63%.
    3.  **Allocate Bundled Price to Handset:** $1,200 (bundled price) Ã— 52.63% = **$631.58**. The closest answer is $667. Let me recheck.

    <!-- end list -->

      * Handset standalone = $800
      * Service standalone = $30 \* 24 = $720
      * Total standalone value = $800 + $720 = $1520
      * Handset proportion = $800 / $1520 = 0.5263
      * Service proportion = $720 / $1520 = 0.4737
      * Revenue for handset at delivery = $1200 \* 0.5263 = $631.56
      * Revenue for service over 2 years = $1200 \* 0.4737 = $568.44
        My calculation gives \~$632. Let me rethink the problem. Perhaps I made an error in logic. The logic of allocating based on relative fair values is correct. It's possible the question intended a different calculation. Let's see if another approach works. What if the question intended a simple allocation?
      * (Handset Value / (Handset Value + Service Value)) \* Total Price
      * ($800 / ($800 + $720)) \* $1200 = $631.58.
        The calculation is robust. It seems the provided answer C ($667) might be based on a different interpretation or a flaw in the question's numbers. Let's see if we can work backwards from $667.
      * $667 / $1200 = 55.6%. How would we get 55.6%?
      * Maybe the service value is different? If service is $20/month -> $480. Total value = $1280. Handset proportion = $800/$1280 = 62.5%. Revenue = $1200 \* 62.5% = $750. No.
      * Maybe the handset value is different? If handset is $600. Total value = $1320. Handset proportion = $600/$1320 = 45%. Revenue = $1200 \* 45% = $545. No.

    Let's assume the question intended a simpler logic, which might be incorrect by the standard but is common in distractors. Is there any way to arrive at $667? What if the service is valued at a discount? The principle is clear: allocate based on standalone selling prices. The calculation based on the data gives $632. Given the choices, there might be an error in the question's intended answer. However, I must choose the best possible logic. I will stick with the correct methodology. *Self-correction: I will re-write the explanation to be clear that my calculation is correct and the provided choice is likely flawed or based on unstated assumptions, but explain why the principle is important.*

**Explanation:**
The correct approach is to allocate the total transaction price ($1,200) based on the relative standalone selling prices of the performance obligations (the handset and the service).

1.  **Calculate Total Standalone Value:** $800 (handset) + $720 (service) = $1,520.
2.  **Determine Allocation Percentage for the Handset:** (Standalone Price of Handset / Total Standalone Value) = $800 / $1,520 â‰ˆ 52.6%.
3.  **Allocate Transaction Price to Handset:** (Total Transaction Price Ã— Allocation Percentage) = $1,200 Ã— 52.6% â‰ˆ $632.

This is the revenue recognized at the point of sale. None of the answer choices match this result, indicating a potential issue with the question's values. However, the principle of allocating a bundled price based on relative standalone values is the key takeaway.

A company with a simple capital structure has net income of $1.5 million. It began the year with 400,000 common shares and issued 200,000 new shares on October 1. Its basic EPS is:

  - A) $3.33
  - B) $3.00
  - C) $2.50

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** First, calculate the weighted-average number of common shares (WACS).
      * Shares from beginning: 400,000 Ã— (12/12) = 400,000
      * New shares issued: 200,000 Ã— (3/12) = 50,000 (since they were outstanding for Oct, Nov, Dec)
      * Total WACS = 400,000 + 50,000 = 450,000
      * Basic EPS = Net Income / WACS = $1,500,000 / 500,000 = **$3.00**.
      * *Correction*: WACS = 450,000. Basic EPS = $1,500,000 / 450,000 = **$3.33**.

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

  * **A is correct.** First, calculate the weighted-average number of common shares (WACS).
      * Shares from beginning of year: 400,000 Ã— (12/12 months) = 400,000
      * New shares issued on Oct 1: 200,000 Ã— (3/12 months) = 50,000
      * Total WACS = 400,000 + 50,000 = 450,000
      * Basic EPS = Net Income / WACS = $1,500,000 / 450,000 = **$3.33**.
  * **B is incorrect.** This result uses 500,000 shares in the denominator, perhaps by weighting the new issue for 6 months instead of 3.
  * **C is incorrect.** This result incorrectly uses the ending number of shares (600,000) in the denominator.

  - C) Excluded from the income statement entirely until it is sold.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** Once a component is classified as "held for sale," its operating results (income or loss for the period) are removed from continuing operations and reported separately in the discontinued operations section of the income statement, net of tax. This applies even if the sale has not yet been completed. Any impairment loss (if the fair value less selling costs is below the book value) would also be included here.
  * **A is incorrect.** The results must be segregated from continuing operations.

An analyst observes that a manufacturing company uses a 20-year useful life to depreciate its machinery, while its direct competitors use a 10-year life for similar equipment. This choice will *most likely* result in the company reporting, in the early years of an asset's life, a higher:

  - A) Cash flow from operations.
  - B) Net income.
  - C) Revenue.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** Using a longer useful life results in a lower annual depreciation expense. Lower expenses lead directly to higher reported pretax income and net income in the early years of an asset's life compared to using a shorter life. An analyst might view this as an aggressive accounting choice that inflates current earnings.
  * **A is incorrect.** Depreciation is a non-cash expense. While it's added back to net income to calculate CFO, the choice of depreciation period itself doesn't affect CFO (assuming taxes are paid in cash).

A company had 1,000,000 common shares outstanding on January 1. On April 1, it issued 300,000 new shares. On June 30, the company effected a 2-for-1 stock split. The weighted-average number of common shares to be used in calculating annual EPS is:

  - A) 2,450,000
  - B) 2,900,000
  - C) 2,600,000

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** When a stock split or stock dividend occurs, it must be applied retrospectively to all share amounts outstanding before the split.

    1.  **Shares from Jan 1 to Mar 31:** 1,000,000 shares Ã— (3/12) = 250,000. These shares were outstanding before the split, so we adjust them: 250,000 Ã— 2 = 500,000.
    2.  **Shares from Apr 1 to June 30:** After the new issue, there were 1,300,000 shares. 1,300,000 shares Ã— (3/12) = 325,000. These were also outstanding before the split, so we adjust them: 325,000 Ã— 2 = 650,000.
    3.  **Shares from July 1 to Dec 31:** After the split, there were 1,300,000 Ã— 2 = 2,600,000 shares. 2,600,000 shares Ã— (6/12) = 1,300,000.
    4.  **Total WACS:** 500,000 + 650,000 + 1,300,000 = **2,450,000**.

    *Let me re-read the question and re-calculate. The retrospective application is key.*

      * **Method 2 (Simpler):**
      * **Beginning shares (Jan 1):** 1,000,000. Since they were outstanding before the split, treat them as 1,000,000 Ã— 2 = 2,000,000 for the entire year. Weighting = 2,000,000 Ã— (12/12) = 2,000,000.
      * **Issued shares (Apr 1):** 300,000. These were issued before the split, so treat them as 300,000 Ã— 2 = 600,000. They were outstanding for 9 months (Apr-Dec). Weighting = 600,000 Ã— (9/12) = 450,000.
      * **Total WACS:** 2,000,000 + 450,000 = **2,450,000**.

Both my methods arrive at 2,450,000. Answer A is 2,450,000. Let me check the provided answer key. Answer B is 2,900,000. Let's see how one might get 2,900,000.

  * (1,300,000 shares pre-split \* 6/12 \* 2) + (2,600,000 shares post-split \* 6/12) = 1,300,000 + 1,300,000 = 2,600,000. This is choice C.
  * Maybe the split applies to the issuance too? (1,000,000 \* 2 \* 12/12) + (300,000 \* 2 \* 9/12) = 2,000,000 + 450,000 = 2,450,000. Still A.
  * What if the split is not applied retrospectively to the beginning shares? (1,000,000 \* 6/12) + (2,600,000 \* 6/12) = 500,000 + 1,300,000 = 1,800,000. No.

The correct method is to treat the split as if it occurred at the beginning of the period.

1.  Shares at Jan 1: 1,000,000
2.  Shares issued Apr 1: 300,000
3.  Apply 2-for-1 split: All prior share amounts are multiplied by 2.
      * WACS = [(1,000,000 Ã— 2) Ã— (12/12)] + [(300,000 Ã— 2) Ã— (9/12)]
      * WACS = [2,000,000] + [600,000 Ã— 0.75]
      * WACS = 2,000,000 + 450,000 = **2,450,000**.
        Answer A is the correct one based on standard accounting procedures. I will proceed with A as the correct answer.

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

  * **A is correct.** Stock splits must be applied retroactively to the beginning of the period for the EPS calculation.
    1.  Treat the 1,000,000 shares from the beginning of the year as 1,000,000 Ã— 2 = 2,000,000 shares for the whole year.
    2.  Treat the 300,000 shares issued on April 1 as 300,000 Ã— 2 = 600,000 shares. These were outstanding for 9 months (April-December).
    3.  Calculate the weighted average:
          * (2,000,000 shares Ã— 12/12) + (600,000 shares Ã— 9/12) = 2,000,000 + 450,000 = **2,450,000**.

    </details>

The core principle of the converged revenue recognition standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict:

  - A) The receipt of cash from the customer.
  - B) The signing of a legally enforceable contract.
  - C) The transfer of promised goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled to.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  * **C is correct.** This statement is the explicit core principle of both IFRS 15 and ASC 606. It focuses on the transfer of control of goods/services and the consideration expected in return, moving away from older, more prescriptive rules.
  * **A is incorrect.** Revenue can be recognized before or after cash is received (e.g., in credit sales or sales with upfront payments).
  * **B is incorrect.** A contract is necessary (Step 1), but revenue is recognized only when performance obligations are satisfied (Step 5).

    </details>

If a company's gross profit margin increases but its operating profit margin decreases, this would *most likely* suggest:

  - A) The company raised its prices or lowered its direct production costs, but its administrative and marketing expenses grew at an even faster rate.
  - B) The company's interest expense increased significantly.
  - C) The company's cost of goods sold increased as a percentage of sales.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

  * **A is correct.** An increasing gross margin indicates improved performance in the core business of producing/procuring and selling goods (higher prices or lower COGS). A decreasing operating margin means that this improvement was more than offset by an increase in operating expenses (like SG\&A) as a percentage of sales.
  * **B is incorrect.** Interest expense is a non-operating expense and would affect the pretax margin, not the operating margin.
  * **C is incorrect.** An increase in COGS as a percentage of sales would cause the gross profit margin to decrease, not increase.

Compared to expensing a cost, capitalizing it will result in which of the following effects on financial ratios over the asset's entire life?

  - A) Total net income will be higher.
  - B) Total cash flow from operations will be higher.
  - C) Total cash flow will be the same.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  * **C is correct.** Over the entire life of an asset, the total amount of expense recognized will be the same whether it is capitalized and depreciated or expensed immediately. Therefore, total net income over the asset's life will be the same. The key difference is timing. Similarly, while capitalization shifts the initial cash outflow from operating (CFO) to investing (CFI), the total cash outflow for the company is identical in both scenarios ($X is spent regardless of accounting treatment). The choice only affects the classification of the cash flow, not the total cash flow itself.
  * **A is incorrect.** Total net income is the same over the asset's life, only the timing of recognition differs.
  * **B is incorrect.** Total CFO will be higher under the capitalization method because the initial outlay is classified as CFI, but total cash flow from all activities will be the same.
