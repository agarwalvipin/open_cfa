### Reading 27: Introduction to Financial Statement Analysis - Practice Questions

#### Vignette 1

An equity analyst is preparing a report on a publicly-traded manufacturing company. The analyst begins by clearly defining the purpose of the analysis, which is to issue a "buy" or "sell" recommendation. The analyst gathers the company's annual reports, SEC filings (including Form 10-K and 10-Q), and recent press releases. They then calculate a series of financial ratios and create common-size financial statements to compare the company's performance to its historical data and to its closest competitors. Finally, the analyst drafts a research report detailing the findings and the investment recommendation.

</details>

Which step of the financial statement analysis framework involves calculating ratios and creating common-size statements?

  - A) Gather data.
  - B) Process the data.
  - C) State the objective and context.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** The third step in the financial statement analysis framework is to process the data. [cite\_start]This step involves making appropriate adjustments to financial statements, calculating ratios, and preparing exhibits like graphs and common-size statements[cite: 871, 924].
  * [cite\_start]**A is incorrect.** Gathering data is the second step, which involves acquiring financial statements and other relevant information[cite: 869, 924].
  * [cite\_start]**C is incorrect.** Stating the objective and context is the first step of the framework[cite: 867, 924].

Based on the vignette, the analyst's final action of drafting the research report corresponds to which step in the financial statement analysis framework?

  - A) Analyze/interpret the data.
  - B) Conclude and make recommendations.
  - C) Communicate the findings.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  * [cite\_start]**C is correct.** The fifth step of the framework is to communicate the analytical results through a report and make recommendations [cite: 866-867]. Drafting the report is the communication phase.
  * **A is incorrect.** Analyzing and interpreting the data is the fourth step, which involves using the processed data to form conclusions. The vignette implies this happens before the report is drafted.
  * **B is incorrect.** While the report contains conclusions and recommendations, the act of preparing the report itself falls under the "communication" step of the framework.

#### Vignette 2

An analyst is comparing two companies in the same industry. Company A prepares its financial statements according to U.S. GAAP and uses the LIFO method for inventory valuation. Company B, based in Europe, uses IFRS and the FIFO method. The analyst also notes that Company A's auditor issued an unqualified opinion, but included a section discussing a significant uncertainty related to ongoing litigation. Company B's auditor issued a standard unqualified opinion.

</details>

When comparing the inventory turnover ratios of Company A and Company B during a period of rising prices, the analyst should be aware that:

  - A) Company Aâ€™s reported inventory turnover is likely to be lower than Company B's.
  - B) The different inventory valuation methods will have no impact on the comparability of the turnover ratios.
  - C) Company A's reported inventory turnover is likely to be higher than Company B's.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  * [cite\_start]**C is correct.** U.S. GAAP allows for the use of LIFO, whereas IFRS prohibits it[cite: 906]. In a period of rising prices, the LIFO method results in a higher Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and a lower inventory value on the balance sheet compared to FIFO. The inventory turnover ratio is COGS / Average Inventory. A higher numerator (COGS) and a lower denominator (Inventory) will result in a higher inventory turnover ratio for Company A (using LIFO) compared to Company B (using FIFO).
  * **A is incorrect.** Company A's ratio is expected to be higher, not lower, due to the effects of LIFO accounting in an inflationary environment.
  * [cite\_start]**B is incorrect.** The use of different inventory valuation methods has a significant impact on financial ratios and reduces comparability between firms[cite: 907].

The information regarding the significant uncertainty in Company A's audit report is *most likely* described as a(n):

  - A) Adverse opinion.
  - B) Key Audit Matter.
  - C) Disclaimer of opinion.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** An unqualified (or "clean") audit opinion can still contain additional sections to draw user attention to important issues. A Key Audit Matter (under international standards) or Critical Audit Matter (under U.S. PCAOB standards) is a matter that was of most significance in the current period audit. A significant uncertainty, like major litigation, would be a candidate for such a disclosure.
  * **A is incorrect.** An adverse opinion states that the financial statements are not presented fairly and would be issued if there were pervasive material misstatements.
  * **C is incorrect.** A disclaimer of opinion is issued when the auditor is unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to form an opinion.

  - C) Evaluating a company's ability to generate future cash flows.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** While financial statement analysis provides information about the historical cost and book value of assets, its primary role is not to determine their replacement cost. Asset appraisal is a different discipline.
  * [cite\_start]**A is incorrect.** Using financial statement analysis to make economic decisions, such as investing in securities, is a key role for analysts[cite: 874].
  * [cite\_start]**C is incorrect.** Analysts use financial statement data to evaluate past performance and form opinions about a company's ability to earn profits and generate cash flow in the future[cite: 875].

  - C) Management Discussion and Analysis (MD\&A).

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Explanation:**

  * [cite\_start]**B is correct.** Proxy statements (such as a Form DEF-14A filing) contain information related to matters that come before shareholders for a vote, including the election of board members[cite: 937].
  * **A is incorrect.** A Form 8-K is used to disclose material corporate events as they happen, such as acquisitions or changes in management, not for routine shareholder votes.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Explanation:**

  * [cite\_start]**C is correct.** Important information about accounting methods, estimates, and assumptions is disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements[cite: 929, 935].
  * [cite\_start]**A is incorrect.** The auditor's report provides an opinion on the fairness of the financial statements and their conformity with accounting standards, but does not detail the specific policies themselves[cite: 899].

</details>

An analyst is reviewing a company that has adopted a new accounting standard in the current period. To ensure comparability with previous periods, the analyst should expect the company to:

  - A) Apply the new standard prospectively, without changing prior-period statements.
  - B) Restate prior-period financial statements presented in the current report using the new standard.
  - C) Provide a reconciliation in the auditor's report explaining the impact of the change.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** Changes in accounting policies and corrections of errors generally require retrospective application. [cite\_start]This means that any prior-period financial statements presented in a firmâ€™s current financial statements must be restated to apply the new policy, enhancing comparability over time[cite: 1055, 1160].
  * [cite\_start]**A is incorrect.** Prospective application, where prior statements are not restated, is typically used for changes in accounting estimates, not changes in accounting standards or policies[cite: 1057, 1161].
  * **C is incorrect.** While the impact of the change would be discussed in the financial statement footnotes, the auditor's report's primary function is to provide an opinion, not a detailed reconciliation of accounting changes.

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  * [cite\_start]**C is correct.** Additional sources of information provided by issuers, such as earnings calls, ad hoc presentations, and press releases, are generally not audited[cite: 163, 914].
  * **A is incorrect.** The footnotes are an integral part of the financial statements and are covered by the audit.
  * **B is incorrect.** While the Management commentary (MD\&A) itself is not audited in the same way as the financial statements, it is subject to auditor review and regulatory oversight to ensure it is not misleading.

### Reading 27: Introduction to Financial Statement Analysis - Additional Questions

#### Vignette 1

A junior equity analyst is assigned to cover a new company. The analyst's first task is to determine if the company is a suitable investment for the firm's "growth" portfolio. The analyst downloads the company's annual and quarterly reports, noting in the footnotes that the company uses an accelerated depreciation method for its key assets. They also read the Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD\&A) section, which highlights increasing competition and pressure on profit margins. To gain more timely information, the analyst listens to the webcast of the company's most recent earnings call with investors.

The information about the company's depreciation method is crucial for an analyst because it:

  - A) is the primary focus of the auditor's report.
  - B) affects the comparability of the company's financial statements with those of competitors using different methods.
  - C) provides a definitive forecast of future capital expenditures.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** The footnotes disclose the accounting policies used, such as the depreciation method. An analyst must be aware of these policies to make valid comparisons to other companies that may use different methods (e.g., straight-line depreciation), as this choice affects reported expenses and asset values.
  * **A is incorrect.** While the auditor verifies that appropriate accounting methods are used, the specific choice of method is not the primary focus of the opinion itself, unless it is improperly applied.
  * **C is incorrect.** The depreciation method is a non-cash accounting expense related to past expenditures; it does not provide a forecast of future capital spending.

  * **B is incorrect.** Earnings call presentations are not audited. The annual report's financial data and notes are audited.
  * **C is incorrect.** The MD\&A is a structured and regulated disclosure. While management prepares it, the information in an earnings call can be more biased as it is a less formal communication channel.

A credit analyst at a large bank is evaluating a loan application from a private company. The primary purpose of the analysis is to assess the company's ability to service its debt over the next five years. The analyst receives financial statements from the company, but they do not conform to any major accounting standards (e.g., IFRS or U.S. GAAP). As a first step, the analyst reformats the statements and makes several adjustments to align them more closely with standard industry practices, particularly regarding revenue recognition and expense capitalization.

  - C) Comply with the company's internal reporting requirements.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** When financial statements do not adhere to a common set of standards like IFRS or U.S. GAAP, an analyst must make adjustments to facilitate meaningful comparison with other companies in the same industry. Without a common basis for comparison, ratio analysis and other analytical techniques are unreliable.
  * **A is incorrect.** The analyst is performing credit analysis, not an audit. An external auditor would require adjustments for different reasons (i.e., to conform to a specific reporting framework).
  * **C is incorrect.** The analyst is adjusting the statements to align with external industry practices, not the company's internal rules.

</details>

When comparing a company that reports under IFRS to one that reports under U.S. GAAP, an analyst should be aware that:

  - A) Both standards are identical, making the statements directly comparable.
  - B) IFRS is principles-based while U.S. GAAP is rules-based, which can lead to different accounting treatments for similar transactions.
  - C) U.S. GAAP requires a statement of changes in equity, while IFRS does not.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  * **B is correct.** This is a key conceptual difference between the two reporting systems. IFRS tends to provide general guidelines and relies more on professional judgment (principles-based), whereas U.S. GAAP tends to be more specific and prescriptive (rules-based). This can result in different outcomes even for similar economic events, which an analyst must account for.
  * **A is incorrect.** While the standards have converged in many areas, significant differences remain.
  * **C is incorrect.** Both IFRS and U.S. GAAP require a statement of changes in equity.
