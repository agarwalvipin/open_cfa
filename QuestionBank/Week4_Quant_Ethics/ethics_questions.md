Anna is leaving her current employer, Firm A, to join a competitor, Firm B. Before resigning, Anna asks her largest client at Firm A if he would be interested in moving his account to Firm B. After resigning, Anna uses Firm A's client list, which she copied before leaving, to contact other clients. Which of Anna's actions *most likely* violated Standard IV(A) Loyalty?

- A) Asking her largest client about moving his account before resigning.
- B) Using the copied client list to contact clients after resigning.
- C) Both asking the client before resigning and using the copied client list after resigning.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: C**

  **Explanation:**

  Standard IV(A) Loyalty requires members to act in their employer's best interest while employed. Soliciting the employer's clients *prior* to leaving violates this duty. Furthermore, client lists and records are the property of the employer, and taking them (e.g., copying the list) upon departure is misappropriation and a violation. Simple knowledge of former client names is generally not confidential , but using a copied list is prohibited. Therefore, both actions violated the standard.

Ben, a full-time analyst at an investment bank, is asked by his neighbor to manage his personal investment portfolio on weekends for a small fee. To comply with Standard IV(A) Loyalty regarding independent practice, Ben's *most appropriate* course of action is to:

- A) Undertake the work without informing his employer as it's done outside work hours.
- B) Inform his employer verbally about the arrangement after starting the work.
- C) Provide full details of the proposed arrangement in writing to his employer and obtain the employer's written consent before beginning the activity.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: C**

  **Explanation:**

  Standard IV(A) Loyalty permits independent practice for compensation only if the member provides written notification to their employer detailing the services, compensation, duration, and nature of the activities, and obtains written consent from the employer *before* the independent practice begins. Undertaking the work without notification or consent, or only notifying verbally after starting, would be a violation.

Maria supervises a team of junior analysts. She discovers that the firm's compliance procedures for reviewing research reports are outdated and inadequate based on current industry standards. According to Standard IV(C) Responsibilities of Supervisors, Maria's *first* step should be to:

- A) Report the violation directly to the regulatory authorities.
- B) Decline supervisory responsibility in writing until the system is improved.
- C) Bring the inadequate compliance system to the attention of the firm's management and recommend corrective action.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: C**

  **Explanation:**

  Standard IV(C) requires supervisors to make reasonable efforts to ensure compliance. If a supervisor knows or should know that the firm's compliance procedures are inadequate, they have an obligation to bring this to the attention of senior management and recommend corrective action. Only if the firm is unresponsive might declining supervisory responsibility become necessary . Reporting to regulators is typically not the first step unless required by law or if internal reporting fails.

- C) Ensure the model's inputs are current and appropriate.

<details>

  **Correct Answer: B**

  **Explanation:**

  Standard V(A) requires diligence and a reasonable basis. When using third-party research or models, analysts must make reasonable efforts to ensure the research is sound. This includes understanding the model's assumptions and limitations and ensuring inputs are appropriate . However, recreating the model's code is generally not required, although understanding its methodology is. The analyst must ensure the third-party research itself has a reasonable basis.

An analyst issues a research report stating, "Based on our discounted cash flow analysis, the stock's intrinsic value is \$50, representing significant upside from the current price of \$40. We strongly believe the stock will reach \$50 within 12 months." Which part of this statement *most* needs clarification under Standard V(B) Communication with Clients and Prospective Clients?

- B) The calculated intrinsic value of \$50.
- C) The belief that the stock will reach \$50 within 12 months.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: C**

  **Explanation:**

  Standard V(B)-5 requires members and candidates to distinguish between fact and opinion in the presentation of investment analysis and recommendations. The current price is a fact. The calculated intrinsic value, while based on analysis, is an estimate (opinion). The statement "We strongly believe the stock will reach \$50 within 12 months" is clearly an opinion or forecast about future price movement and should be presented as such, perhaps with supporting reasoning and discussion of risks, rather than as a certainty.

- B) The potential liquidity limitations associated with the investment strategy.
- C) The names of other managers following a similar strategy.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: B**

  **Explanation:**

  Standard V(B)-3 requires members and candidates to disclose significant limitations and risks associated with the investment process to clients and prospective clients. Investing in micro-cap stocks with limited trading volume presents significant liquidity risk (the inability to sell quickly without impacting the price), which is a limitation that must be communicated. Disclosing exact daily volumes or competitor names is not required by this standard.

James Lee, CFA, an analyst, owns shares in Company XYZ. His firm asks him to write a research report on Company XYZ. According to Standard VI(A) Disclosure of Conflicts, James must:

- C) Only disclose his ownership to his employer, not in the report.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: B**

  **Explanation:**

  Standard VI(A) requires members and candidates to make full and fair disclosure of all matters that could reasonably be expected to impair their independence and objectivity. Owning shares in a company that the analyst is recommending is a common and significant conflict that must be disclosed prominently to clients, prospects, and the employer, typically within the research report itself. Selling the shares might resolve the conflict but is not the primary requirement; disclosure is essential if the conflict exists.

- C) Permitted if the personal trade is small relative to client trades.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: B**

  **Explanation:**

  Standard VI(B) Priority of Transactions requires that client and employer transactions have priority over personal transactions. Trading for one's personal account *before* executing client trades in the same security is a violation known as front-running. Members must allow clients an adequate opportunity to act on a recommendation or trade before acting for their own beneficial accounts. Disclosure or trade size does not cure this violation.

An analyst discovers her employer is systematically engaging in illegal activities that harm clients. After internal attempts to stop the activity fail, she reports the activities to government regulators, providing confidential company documents as evidence. Under Standard IV(A) Loyalty, the analyst's actions are:

- A) A violation, because she divulged confidential employer information.
- B) Not a violation, because the duty to protect clients and market integrity supersedes the duty of loyalty to the employer in this case.
- C) A violation, unless she received specific legal advice compelling her to report to regulators.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: B**

  **Explanation:**

  While Standard IV(A) requires loyalty to the employer, this duty does not require members to condone or conceal illegal activities that harm clients or market integrity. The guidance suggests that in isolated cases, violating the duty to the employer may be necessary to protect clients or market integrity, provided the actions are not for personal gain. Reporting illegal activities that harm clients, especially after internal remedies fail, aligns with protecting clients and market integrity, thus likely overriding the loyalty duty in this context. Local laws regarding whistleblowing might also apply but the ethical obligation permits reporting illegal acts harmful to clients.

An analyst is preparing a "Buy" recommendation for a stock, which is expected to be disseminated to clients shortly. Before the recommendation is released, the analyst informs his brother, who then buys the stock. This action is *best* described as a violation of:

- A) Standard VI(B) Priority of Transactions due to front-running.
- B) Standard II(A) Material Nonpublic Information.
- C) Both Standard VI(B) and Standard II(A).

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: A**

  **Explanation:**

  The analyst's action of sharing information about the impending recommendation before clients have a chance to act on it, allowing his brother to trade ahead of clients, is a direct violation of Standard VI(B) Priority of Transactions. This specific type of violation, trading or causing others to trade ahead of anticipated client orders or recommendations, is often referred to as front-running. While the recommendation itself might not yet be *material nonpublic information* in the legal sense (depending on jurisdiction and likely price impact), the act clearly violates the duty to prioritize client transactions and prevent beneficial owners (like the analyst through his brother) from profiting from knowledge of pending client trades/recommendations. Standard VI(B) is the most direct fit for acting on knowledge of *pending* recommendations/trades.

John completed Levels I and II of the CFA Program but did not pass Level III. On his resume, he states "CFA Level III Candidate (Expected Completion 2026)". Which part of Standard VII(B) Reference to CFA Institute, the CFA Designation, and the CFA Program is *most likely* violated?

- A) Exaggerating the meaning of candidacy by implying near completion without being currently registered.
- B) Incorrectly referencing CFA Institute programs.
- C) Failing to pay CFA Institute membership dues.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: A**

  **Explanation:**

  Standard VII(B) prohibits misrepresenting or exaggerating the meaning of candidacy. While stating one is a "Level III Candidate" is permissible *only if currently registered for the Level III exam*, adding "(Expected Completion 2026)" when not currently registered, especially after a previous failure, could be seen as exaggerating one's status and implying progress that isn't guaranteed or officially recognized by enrollment. There is no partial designation , and suggesting expected completion without current registration exaggerates the candidate's standing in the program. Failing to pay dues relates to maintaining *membership* after earning the charter , not candidacy.
