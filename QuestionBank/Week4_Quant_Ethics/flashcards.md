What does Roy's safety-first criterion seek to achieve?;Minimize the probability that portfolio return falls below a minimum acceptable level ($$R_L$$).<br>Choose the portfolio with the highest Safety-First Ratio (SFR).;WK4 Quant Roys Criterion

What is the formula for the Safety-First Ratio (SFR)?;<br>\(SFR = \frac{E(R_p) - R_L}{\sigma_p}\)<br>Measures excess return over threshold per unit of portfolio risk.;WK4 Quant SFR

What key property distinguishes a lognormal distribution from a normal distribution in finance?;It is bounded below by zero.<br>Suitable for asset prices which cannot be negative.;WK4 Quant Lognormal Property

Why is the lognormal distribution often used to model asset prices?;Because asset prices cannot be negative, and if continuously compounded returns are normal, the resulting price is lognormal.;WK4 Quant Lognormal AssetPrices

What is Monte Carlo simulation?;A technique using repeated random sampling from specified probability distributions of inputs to generate a distribution of outcomes.<br>Used for complex valuation, risk analysis (VaR), etc.;WK4 Quant MonteCarlo Def

What is a primary limitation of Monte Carlo simulation?;The results are only as good as the assumptions made about input distributions and the model used.<br>Garbage in, garbage out.;WK4 Quant MonteCarlo Limit

What is bootstrap resampling?;A simulation method that repeatedly draws samples (with replacement) from the observed historical data.<br>Does not require distributional assumptions but limited by historical range.;WK4 Quant Bootstrap Def

What is Standard IV(A) Loyalty primarily concerned with?;Acting for the benefit of the employer and not causing harm, divulging confidential info, or misusing skills/abilities in employment matters.<br>Client interests still come first.;WK4 Ethics Std IV(A) Loyalty

What is the core requirement of Standard VI(A) Disclosure of Conflicts?;Avoid conflicts where possible. Make full, fair, prominent, plain-language disclosure of all matters that could impair independence/objectivity or interfere with duties.<br>Allows clients/employers to judge motives.;WK4 Ethics Std VI(A) Conflicts

According to Standard VI(B) Priority of Transactions, whose transactions come first?;Clients and employers have priority over transactions where the member/candidate is the beneficial owner.<br>Must allow clients/employer adequate opportunity to act first.;WK4 Ethics Std VI(B) Priority

What does Standard VI(C) Referral Fees require?;Disclose any compensation/benefit received from or paid to others for recommending products/services to employer, clients, and prospects as appropriate.<br>Allows evaluation of cost and partiality.;WK4 Ethics Std VI(C) Referral

What conduct related to CFA exams is prohibited by Standard VII(A)?;Cheating; revealing confidential exam info (topics, questions); violating rules; improperly using designation; misrepresenting on PCS.<br>Protects integrity of CFA Institute programs.;WK4 Ethics Std VII(A) Conduct
