## Economics & Corporate Issuers Quiz

### ðŸŸ¢ Q1 â€“ Firms and Market Structures

Under perfect competition, which of the following is *most likely* a characteristic of the firms?

  - A) They are price searchers.
  - B) They face a perfectly elastic demand curve.
  - C) They produce differentiated products.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  - **B is correct.** In a perfectly competitive market, each firm is a price taker and can sell all it wants at the market price. This means it faces a horizontal, or perfectly elastic, demand curve.
  - **A is incorrect.** Firms in perfect competition are price takers, not price searchers. They have no control over the market price.
  - **C is incorrect.** Firms in perfect competition sell identical, homogeneous products, not differentiated ones.

### ðŸŸ¢ Q2 â€“ Understanding Business Cycles

Which phase of the business cycle is *best described* as a period of slowing growth, rising inventories, and declining business investment?

  - A) Contraction
  - B) Peak
  - C) Trough

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  - **B is correct.** The peak of the business cycle marks the end of the expansion phase. During this time, economic activity begins to slow, inventories start to accumulate as sales growth declines, and firms cut back on investment.
  - **A is incorrect.** A contraction is a period of negative economic growth, which follows the peak.
  - **C is incorrect.** A trough is the lowest point of a business cycle, after which economic activity begins to recover.

</details>

### ðŸŸ¡ Q3 â€“ Fiscal Policy

A government decides to simultaneously increase taxes by $100 million and increase government spending by $100 million. This action is *most likely* to:

  - A) have no effect on aggregate demand.
  - B) increase aggregate demand.
  - C) decrease aggregate demand.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  - **B is correct.** This scenario describes the balanced budget multiplier. An increase in government spending directly increases aggregate demand by the full amount ($100 million). The tax increase reduces disposable income, but not all of that income would have been spent. A portion would have been saved. Therefore, the reduction in consumption is less than the increase in government spending, leading to a net increase in aggregate demand.
  - **A is incorrect.** The effects are not equal and offsetting. The multiplier for government spending is higher than the multiplier for taxes.
  - **C is incorrect.** Aggregate demand will increase, not decrease.

</details>

-----

### ðŸŸ¢ Q4 â€“ Monetary Policy

Which of the following is *least likely* a primary objective of a central bank?

  - A) Controlling inflation.
  - B) Ensuring financial stability.
  - C) Funding the government's fiscal deficit.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  - **C is correct.** While a central bank might purchase government bonds as part of its open market operations, its primary goal is not to directly fund the government's deficit. Doing so can compromise the central bank's independence and lead to high inflation (monetizing the debt).
  - **A and B are incorrect.** Controlling inflation and maintaining financial stability are core, universally recognized objectives of most central banks.

</details>

-----

### ðŸŸ¢ Q5 â€“ Introduction to Geopolitics

Geopolitics is *best described* as the study of the effects of:

  - A) geography on international politics and relations.
  - B) domestic policies on economic growth.
  - C) population demographics on market structures.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

  - **A is correct.** Geopolitics is fundamentally about the interplay between geography (e.g., location, resources, climate) and power dynamics in international relations.
  - **B and C are incorrect.** While domestic policies and demographics are important economic factors, they do not define the core focus of geopolitics, which is international in scope.

</details>

-----

### ðŸŸ¡ Q6 â€“ International Trade

A country imposes a tariff on imported automobiles. The *most likely* result is that:

  - A) the domestic government's revenue will decrease.
  - B) domestic automobile producers will benefit.
  - C) domestic consumer surplus will increase.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  - **B is correct.** A tariff increases the price of imported goods, making domestically produced substitutes (automobiles in this case) more competitive. This allows domestic producers to sell more units or raise their prices, increasing their producer surplus.
  - **A is incorrect.** A tariff is a tax on imports, so it generates revenue for the government.
  - **C is incorrect.** Consumers face higher prices for both imported and domestic automobiles, which reduces their consumer surplus.

</details>

-----

### ðŸŸ¢ Q7 â€“ Capital Flows and the FX Market

An investor in the United Kingdom purchases bonds issued by a U.S. company. From the perspective of the United States, this transaction would *most likely* be recorded in the:

  - A) current account.
  - B) capital account.
  - C) financial account.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  - **C is correct.** The financial account records portfolio investments (like stocks and bonds) and direct investments across borders. A foreign investor buying domestic bonds is a capital inflow recorded in the financial account.
  - **A is incorrect.** The current account records trade in goods and services, investment income, and unilateral transfers.
  - **B is incorrect.** The capital account records capital transfers and the sale/purchase of non-produced, non-financial assets (like patents). It is typically very small for most developed countries.

</details>

### ðŸŸ¡ Q8 â€“ Exchange Rate Calculations

An exchange rate between the US dollar (USD) and the Swiss franc (CHF) is quoted as 0.9150 USD/CHF. The *most appropriate* interpretation of this quote is:

  - A) 1 CHF costs 0.9150 USD.
  - B) 1 USD costs 0.9150 CHF.
  - C) 1 CHF costs 1.0929 USD.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

  - **A is correct.** In the "price currency / base currency" convention, the quote `0.9150 USD/CHF` means that 0.9150 units of the price currency (USD) are needed to buy one unit of the base currency (CHF).
  - **B is incorrect.** This would be the interpretation of a 0.9150 CHF/USD quote.
  - **C is incorrect.** This is the inverse of the quote (1 / 0.9150 = 1.0929), which would represent the CHF/USD exchange rate.

</details>

### ðŸŸ¡ Q9 â€“ Firms and Market Structures

A market structure characterized by a few large firms, high barriers to entry, and interdependent decision-making is *best described* as:

  - A) a monopoly.
  - B) an oligopoly.
  - C) monopolistic competition.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  - **B is correct.** Oligopoly is defined by the presence of a few dominant firms. Because of their size, their pricing and output decisions are interdependent (one firm's actions affect the others), and there are significant barriers to entry.
  - **A is incorrect.** A monopoly consists of a single firm.
  - **C is incorrect.** Monopolistic competition involves many firms and low barriers to entry, but with differentiated products.

</details>

-----

### ðŸ”´ Q10 â€“ Understanding Business Cycles

The Austrian school of economic thought would *most likely* attribute the primary cause of a business cycle to:

  - A) excessive optimism and "animal spirits" from the private sector.
  - B) shocks to an economy's aggregate supply curve.
  - C) artificially low interest rates set by a central bank.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  - **C is correct.** The Austrian school posits that business cycles are caused by government intervention, specifically central banks manipulating interest rates below their natural level. This sends false signals to entrepreneurs, leading to malinvestment (investment in unsustainable projects) and an inevitable bust.
  - **A is incorrect.** This is a key tenet of Keynesian theory.
  - **B is incorrect.** This is the focus of Real Business Cycle (RBC) theory.

</details>

-----

### ðŸŸ¢ Q11 â€“ Fiscal Policy

Which of the following is an example of an automatic stabilizer in fiscal policy?

  - A) A government program to build new highways during a recession.
  - B) A progressive income tax system.
  - C) An annual decision by policymakers to lower tax rates.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  - **B is correct.** Automatic stabilizers are built-in features of the tax and transfer system that work to dampen business cycle fluctuations without direct government action. In a progressive tax system, tax revenues automatically fall during a recession (as incomes fall), cushioning the decline in aggregate demand. Conversely, revenues rise in an expansion.
  - **A and C are incorrect.** These are examples of discretionary fiscal policy, which requires explicit action by policymakers.

</details>

-----

### ðŸŸ¡ Q12 â€“ Monetary Policy

If a central bank wants to implement a contractionary monetary policy, which action would be *most appropriate*?

  - A) Selling government securities on the open market.
  - B) Lowering the policy interest rate.
  - C) Decreasing the reserve requirement.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

  - **A is correct.** Selling government securities through open market operations reduces the reserves of commercial banks. This restricts their ability to lend, which increases short-term interest rates and contracts the money supply, thereby dampening aggregate demand.
  - **B is incorrect.** Lowering the policy rate is an expansionary policy.
  - **C is incorrect.** Decreasing the reserve requirement is an expansionary policy as it allows banks to lend out a larger portion of their deposits.

</details>

-----

### ðŸŸ¡ Q13 â€“ Introduction to Geopolitics

An investment analyst is evaluating a multinational corporation with significant production facilities in a country known for political instability. Which of the following geopolitical factors is the *most* direct concern?

  - A) Global climate change agreements.
  - B) The host country's social infrastructure.
  - C) The risk of expropriation of assets.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  - **C is correct.** Expropriation, the act of a government seizing foreign-owned assets, is a primary and severe geopolitical risk for firms with physical operations in politically unstable countries.
  - **A is incorrect.** Climate change agreements are a form of geopolitical risk, but they are global in nature and less direct than the risk of asset seizure in a specific unstable country.
  - **B is incorrect.** Social infrastructure (like education and healthcare) is a country-level factor but is a less immediate or acute geopolitical risk compared to expropriation.

</details>

-----

### ðŸ”´ Q14 â€“ International Trade

All of the following are true for a customs union *except* that member countries:

  - A) adopt a common set of trade restrictions with non-members.
  - B) allow free movement of factors of production among members.
  - C) eliminate all trade barriers among themselves.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  - **B is correct.** A customs union involves (1) eliminating trade barriers among members and (2) adopting a common external trade policy. The free movement of factors of production (labor and capital) is a feature of a more deeply integrated trading bloc, the common market.
  - **A and C are incorrect.** These are defining characteristics of a customs union.

</details>

-----

### ðŸŸ¡ Q15 â€“ Capital Flows and the FX Market

A forward contract on a currency is *best described* as an agreement to:

  - A) exchange a specific amount of one currency for another at the current spot rate.
  - B) exchange a specific amount of one currency for another on a specified future date at a pre-determined rate.
  - C) buy or sell a currency at any time up to a specified expiration date.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  - **B is correct.** A forward contract is a customized agreement between two parties to buy or sell an asset (in this case, a currency) at a specified price (the forward rate) on a future date.
  - **A is incorrect.** This describes a spot transaction.
  - **C is incorrect.** This describes an option contract, which gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to trade.

</details>

-----

### ðŸ”´ Q16 â€“ Exchange Rate Calculations

An analyst is given the following quotes:

  - USD/EUR: 1.1000
  - GBP/USD: 1.2500

To find the GBP/EUR cross-rate, the analyst should calculate:

  - A) 1.1000 Ã— 1.2500
  - B) 1.1000 / 1.2500
  - C) 1.2500 / 1.1000

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

  - **A is correct.** To derive the GBP/EUR cross-rate, the "chain rule" is used to cancel out the common currency (USD).
    $$\frac{GBP}{EUR} = \frac{USD}{EUR} \times \frac{GBP}{USD}$$
    $$\frac{GBP}{EUR} = 1.1000 \times 1.2500 = 1.3750$$
  - **B and C are incorrect.** These calculations do not properly align the currencies to cancel out the USD and derive the GBP/EUR rate.

</details>

-----

### ðŸŸ¡ Q17 â€“ Firms and Market Structures

In a market of monopolistic competition, firms are *least likely* to:

  - A) earn economic profits in the long run.
  - B) engage in advertising and product promotion.
  - C) face a downward-sloping demand curve.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

  - **A is correct.** Due to low barriers to entry, any short-run economic profits will attract new competitors. This increases market supply and competition, eroding profits until they reach zero in the long run (i.e., firms earn only a normal rate of return).
  - **B is incorrect.** Firms in monopolistic competition rely heavily on advertising and promotion to differentiate their products from competitors'.
  - **C is incorrect.** Because each firm's product is slightly differentiated, each firm has some market power and faces a downward-sloping demand curve.

</details>

-----

### ðŸŸ¢ Q18 â€“ Understanding Business Cycles

Which of the following economic indicators is *most likely* a lagging indicator of the business cycle?

  - A) Average weekly hours in manufacturing.
  - B) Building permits for new private housing units.
  - C) The average prime rate charged by banks.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  - **C is correct.** The average prime rate, which is the interest rate banks charge their most creditworthy customers, tends to change only after the economy has already begun to follow a particular trend.
  - **A and B are incorrect.** Average weekly hours and building permits are both leading indicators, as businesses adjust hours and plans for new construction in anticipation of future economic activity.

</details>

-----

### ðŸ”´ Q19 â€“ Fiscal Policy

The concept of Ricardian equivalence *would be consistent with* which of the following statements?

  - A) A tax cut financed by government borrowing will stimulate consumption and aggregate demand.
  - B) A tax cut financed by government borrowing will not stimulate consumption because taxpayers anticipate future tax increases.
  - C) Fiscal policy is a more effective tool for managing the economy than monetary policy.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  - **B is correct.** Ricardian equivalence is a theory suggesting that when a government tries to stimulate demand by increasing debt-financed spending, taxpayers will anticipate that they will have to pay higher taxes in the future to service that debt. As a result, they increase their savings to pay for the future tax liability, offsetting the impact of the government's stimulus.
  - **A is incorrect.** This is the Keynesian view, which Ricardian equivalence directly contradicts.
  - **C is incorrect.** Ricardian equivalence suggests a major limitation of fiscal policy, implying it might be ineffective.

</details>

-----

### ðŸŸ¡ Q20 â€“ Monetary Policy

The "money neutrality" proposition suggests that in the long run, an increase in the money supply will *most likely* only affect:

  - A) the price level.
  - B) real output.
  - C) employment levels.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

  - **A is correct.** Money neutrality is the idea that changes in the money supply only affect nominal variables (like prices and wages) but do not affect real variables (like real GDP, employment, or consumption).
  - **B and C are incorrect.** These are real variables that are believed to be unaffected by changes in the money supply in the long run.

</details>

-----

### ðŸŸ¢ Q21 â€“ Firms and Market Structures

Which of the following *best describes* the demand curve faced by a pure monopolist?

  - A) Perfectly elastic.
  - B) The market demand curve.
  - C) The same as its marginal revenue curve.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  - **B is correct.** A pure monopolist is the only producer in a market. Therefore, the demand curve for the monopolist's product is the entire market demand curve, which is downward sloping.
  - **A is incorrect.** A perfectly elastic (horizontal) demand curve is faced by firms in perfect competition.
  - **C is incorrect.** For a monopolist facing a downward-sloping demand curve, the marginal revenue curve lies below the demand curve.

</details>

-----

### ðŸŸ¡ Q22 â€“ Understanding Business Cycles

A business cycle theory that focuses on changes in technology and productivity as the primary drivers of economic fluctuations is *best described* as:

  - A) Keynesian theory.
  - B) Monetarist theory.
  - C) Real Business Cycle theory.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  - **C is correct.** Real Business Cycle (RBC) theory posits that business cycles are caused by real shocks, such as innovations, technological progress, or changes in the prices of key inputs, which affect the aggregate supply in an economy.
  - **A is incorrect.** Keynesian theory emphasizes changes in aggregate demand as the primary cause of business cycles.
  - **B is incorrect.** Monetarist theory focuses on the role of the money supply in driving economic cycles.

</details>

-----

### ðŸŸ¡ Q23 â€“ Fiscal Policy

If a country has a high national debt, the *most likely* constraint on the effectiveness of its expansionary fiscal policy is:

  - A) the crowding-out effect.
  - B) the inability to print money.
  - C) deflationary pressures.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

  - **A is correct.** When a government with a high debt level engages in further deficit spending (expansionary policy), it must borrow more from the market. This increased demand for loanable funds can drive up interest rates, which in turn reduces (or "crowds out") private investment and interest-sensitive consumption, offsetting the intended stimulus.
  - **B is incorrect.** Most sovereign nations can print money, though it has severe consequences. This is a monetary, not fiscal, action.
  - **C is incorrect.** Expansionary fiscal policy is intended to combat deflationary pressures, not be constrained by them.

</details>

-----

### ðŸ”´ Q24 â€“ Monetary Policy

A central bank's policy of quantitative easing would *violate* the traditional approach to monetary policy in that it:

  - A) targets short-term interest rates.
  - B) involves the purchase of long-term government bonds and other assets.
  - C) is used exclusively to reduce inflation.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  - **B is correct.** Traditional open market operations focus on buying and selling short-term government securities to influence the overnight interbank lending rate. Quantitative easing (QE) is an unconventional policy where the central bank purchases longer-term government bonds and often other assets (like mortgage-backed securities) to directly lower long-term interest rates and increase the monetary base.
  - **A is incorrect.** Traditional policy *does* target short-term interest rates.
  - **C is incorrect.** QE is an expansionary policy used to combat deflation and stimulate the economy when short-term rates are already near zero.

</details>

-----

### ðŸŸ¢ Q25 â€“ Introduction to Geopolitics

The emergence of a new, disruptive technology that shifts global supply chains is *best* described as a geopolitical manifestation of:

  - A) social factors.
  - B) political factors.
  - C) technological factors.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  - **C is correct.** Technology is a key driver of geopolitical change. Innovations can alter economic dependencies, create new industries, and shift the balance of power between nations, all of which are central to geopolitical analysis.
  - **A and B are incorrect.** While the technological shift may have social and political consequences, its origin is technological.

</details>

### ðŸŸ¡ Q26 â€“ International Trade

Country A has a comparative advantage in producing wheat, while Country B has a comparative advantage in producing cloth. According to the theory of comparative advantage, which of the following outcomes is *most likely* if the two countries trade?

  - A) Both countries will be worse off.
  - B) Country A will specialize in cloth, and Country B will specialize in wheat.
  - C) Total output of both wheat and cloth will be higher than it would be without trade.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  - **C is correct.** The principle of comparative advantage states that when countries specialize in producing the goods for which they have a lower opportunity cost and trade with each other, global production and consumption possibilities increase for all participating countries.
  - **A is incorrect.** Trade based on comparative advantage leads to mutual gains.
  - **B is incorrect.** Each country should specialize in the good in which it has a comparative advantage; therefore, Country A should specialize in wheat and Country B in cloth.

</details>

-----

### ðŸŸ¡ Q27 â€“ Capital Flows and the FX Market

A significant increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) into a country will *most likely* cause the domestic currency to:

  - A) depreciate.
  - B) appreciate.
  - C) remain unchanged.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  - **B is correct.** Foreign direct investment (e.g., a foreign company building a factory in the domestic country) is a capital inflow. To make the investment, foreign investors must sell their currency and buy the domestic currency, increasing the demand for the domestic currency and causing it to appreciate.
  - **A and C are incorrect.** The increased demand will put upward pressure on the currency's value.

</details>

-----

### ðŸ”´ Q28 â€“ Exchange Rate Calculations

An analyst observes the following spot rates:

  - JPY/USD: 150.00
  - CHF/USD: 0.9000
  - JPY/CHF: 165.00

To execute a triangular arbitrage, an investor starting with USD should *most appropriately*:

  - A) buy CHF with USD, then buy JPY with CHF, then buy USD with JPY.
  - B) buy JPY with USD, then buy CHF with JPY, then buy USD with CHF.
  - C) not engage in arbitrage as the rates are in equilibrium.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

  - **A is correct.** First, calculate the implied cross-rate: JPY/CHF = (JPY/USD) / (CHF/USD) = 150.00 / 0.9000 = 166.67. The market rate is 165.00, which is lower than the implied rate. This means the Japanese Yen is undervalued relative to the Swiss Franc in the direct JPY/CHF market. The strategy is to buy the undervalued asset.
    1.  Start with USD, buy the "overvalued" currency (CHF).
    2.  Use the CHF to buy the "undervalued" currency (JPY) in the direct market at the favorable rate of 165.00.
    3.  Convert the JPY back to USD at the 150.00 rate to realize a profit.
  - **B is incorrect.** This strategy would result in a loss because it involves buying the relatively overvalued currency (CHF) with the relatively undervalued one (JPY).
  - **C is incorrect.** An arbitrage opportunity exists because the market cross-rate (165.00) is different from the implied cross-rate (166.67).

</details>

### ðŸŸ¢ Q29 â€“ Firms and Market Structures

In the long run, a firm in a perfectly competitive market will *most likely* produce at an output level where:

  - A) marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost.
  - B) price is greater than average total cost.
  - C) marginal cost equals minimum average total cost.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  - **C is correct.** In long-run equilibrium under perfect competition, firms produce at the most efficient scale, which is the lowest point on the long-run average total cost curve. At this point, Price = Marginal Revenue = Marginal Cost = Average Total Cost, and economic profit is zero.
  - **A is incorrect.** If MR \> MC, the firm could increase profit by producing more.
  - **B is incorrect.** If P \> ATC, the firm would be earning an economic profit, which would attract new firms, driving the price down to the minimum ATC.

</details>

### ðŸŸ¡ Q30 â€“ Understanding Business Cycles

Which of the following unemployment types is *most likely* to be at its lowest point at the peak of a business cycle?

  - A) Frictional unemployment.
  - B) Structural unemployment.
  - C) Cyclical unemployment.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  - **C is correct.** Cyclical unemployment is the unemployment that results directly from cycles of economic upturn and downturn. It is at its highest during a recession and is at or near zero at the peak of a business cycle when the economy is operating at its full potential.
  - **A and B are incorrect.** Frictional (due to job transitions) and structural (due to a mismatch of skills and jobs) unemployment are always present in a dynamic economy and constitute the "natural" rate of unemployment.

</details>

-----

### ðŸŸ¢ Q31 â€“ International Trade

A country's balance of payments must always sum to:

  - A) its GDP.
  - B) its trade deficit.
  - C) zero.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  - **C is correct.** The balance of payments is an accounting statement that records all economic transactions between a country and the rest of the world. Based on double-entry bookkeeping, the sum of the current account, capital account, and financial account must equal zero. A current account deficit, for example, must be financed by a surplus in the other accounts.

</details>

-----

### ðŸŸ¡ Q32 â€“ Exchange Rate Calculations

The spot EUR/USD exchange rate is 1.1500. The 1-year forward rate is 1.1615. The US dollar is trading at a forward:

  - A) discount of 1.0%.
  - B) premium of 1.0%.
  - C) discount of 1.0%.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

  - **A is correct.** The forward premium or discount on the base currency (USD) is calculated as [(Forward/Spot) - 1].
    $$\left( \frac{1.1500}{1.1615} - 1 \right) \approx -0.010 = -1.0\%$$
    Since the value is negative, the base currency (USD) is trading at a forward discount. Alternatively, since it takes more EUR to buy a USD in the spot market (1/1.1500 = 0.8696) than in the forward market (1/1.1615 = 0.8609), the USD is weaker in the forward market, meaning it trades at a discount.

</details>

### ðŸŸ¡ Q33 â€“ Firms and Market Structures

An oligopolistic market is *most likely* to exhibit price rigidity because:

  - A) firms' marginal costs are constant over large ranges of output.
  - B) firms have an incentive to cheat on collusive agreements.
  - C) firms anticipate that competitors will match price cuts but not price increases.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  - **C is correct.** This describes the reasoning behind the "kinked demand curve" model of oligopoly. Each firm believes that if it cuts its price, its rivals will follow suit to avoid losing market share, leading to a small gain in sales. However, if it raises its price, rivals will not follow, leading to a large loss of sales. This fear of a price war or losing market share creates an incentive for firms to keep prices stable.
  - **A is incorrect.** While possible, this is not the primary explanation for price rigidity in this model.
  - **B is incorrect.** While true that firms have an incentive to cheat, this fact explains why cartels are hard to maintain, not why prices are often rigid.

</details>

### ðŸŸ¢ Q34 â€“ Monetary Policy

The primary tool used by most central banks to conduct monetary policy is:

  - A) the reserve requirement.
  - B) open market operations.
  - C) the discount rate.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  - **B is correct.** Open market operations (the purchase and sale of government securities) are the most common and flexible tool for implementing monetary policy. They allow for fine-tuning of the money supply and short-term interest rates on a daily basis.
  - **A and C are incorrect.** Changes to the reserve requirement and the discount/lending rate are less frequently used as they are considered more blunt instruments.

### ðŸ”´ Q35 â€“ Fiscal Policy

A government is pursuing an expansionary fiscal policy. The effectiveness of this policy would be *least* impacted by which of the following?

  - A) The policy is implemented when the economy is already at full employment.
  - B) There is a significant time lag between recognizing an economic problem and implementing a policy response.
  - C) The central bank simultaneously implements a contractionary monetary policy.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  - **B is correct.** While time lags are a practical problem with fiscal policy, they relate to the *implementation* and *timing* of the policy's effect, not its fundamental power or magnitude. The other two options directly counteract the force of the fiscal policy itself.
  - **A is incorrect.** If the economy is already at full employment, an expansionary policy will likely just cause inflation rather than increase real output, making it ineffective at boosting real growth.
  - **C is incorrect.** If fiscal policy is expansionary (trying to boost AD) while monetary policy is contractionary (trying to reduce AD), the two policies will work against each other, significantly reducing the net impact of the fiscal stimulus.

### ðŸŸ¡ Q36 â€“ International Trade

Which of the following trade restrictions is *most likely* to generate revenue for the government?

  - A) A tariff.
  - B) A quota.
  - C) A voluntary export restraint.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

  - **A is correct.** A tariff is a tax levied on imported goods, and the revenue from this tax is collected by the government.
  - **B is incorrect.** A quota is a limit on the quantity of a good that can be imported. It does not inherently generate government revenue. The financial benefit (quota rent) typically goes to the foreign producers or domestic importers who hold the import licenses.
  - **C is incorrect.** A voluntary export restraint (VER) is an agreement where an exporting country voluntarily limits its exports. This does not generate revenue for the importing country's government.

### ðŸŸ¢ Q37 â€“ Understanding Business Cycles

Inflation is *most likely* to accelerate during which phase of the business cycle?

  - A) Expansion.
  - B) Contraction.
  - C) Trough.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

  - **A is correct.** During an expansion, aggregate demand is increasing, employment is rising, and production capacity becomes more constrained. This combination puts upward pressure on wages and prices, leading to accelerating inflation, especially late in the expansion phase as the economy approaches its peak.
  - **B and C are incorrect.** During contractions and troughs, weak demand and high unemployment typically lead to disinflation (a slowing of inflation) or even deflation.

### ðŸ”´ Q38 â€“ Firms and Market Structures

A monopolist wants to maximize profit. The firm will *least likely* choose an output level where:

  - A) marginal revenue equals marginal cost.
  - B) demand is inelastic.
  - C) price is greater than marginal cost.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  - **B is correct.** A profit-maximizing monopolist will always produce on the elastic portion of the demand curve. In the inelastic portion, a price increase would increase total revenue (and likely decrease total cost as output falls), thus increasing profit. Therefore, any point in the inelastic region cannot be the profit-maximizing output level.
  - **A is incorrect.** The condition MR=MC is the universal rule for profit maximization for all firms.
  - **C is incorrect.** Since a monopolist faces a downward-sloping demand curve, price is always greater than marginal revenue. Because the firm produces where MR=MC, it must be that P \> MC.

### ðŸŸ¡ Q39 â€“ Exchange Rate Calculations

The AUD/CAD spot rate is 0.9200. The 3-month forward rate is 0.9150. This indicates that:

  - A) Canadian interest rates are higher than Australian interest rates.
  - B) Australian interest rates are higher than Canadian interest rates.
  - C) The two countries' interest rates are equal.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

  - **B is correct.** According to interest rate parity, the currency with the higher interest rate will trade at a forward discount. The AUD is the base currency. Since the forward rate (0.9150) is lower than the spot rate (0.9200), the base currency (AUD) is trading at a discount. Therefore, Australian interest rates must be higher than Canadian interest rates.

### ðŸŸ¢ Q40 â€“ Capital Flows and the FX Market

Which of the following is *least likely* to be a direct participant in the foreign exchange market?

  - A) A multinational corporation.
  - B) A national government's central bank.
  - C) A domestic retail investor buying local stocks.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

  - **C is correct.** A retail investor buying local stocks is transacting entirely within the domestic currency and domestic market. They are not exchanging one currency for another.
  - **A is incorrect.** Multinational corporations are major participants, constantly needing to convert currencies for international trade, investment, and repatriating profits.
  - **B is incorrect.** Central banks participate in the FX market to influence their currency's value, manage foreign reserves, and implement monetary policy.
