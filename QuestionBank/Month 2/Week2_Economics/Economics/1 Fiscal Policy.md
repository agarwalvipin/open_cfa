Which of the following is a primary tool of fiscal policy?
- A) Open market operations
- B) Government spending
- C) The policy rate

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* [cite_start]**B is correct.** Government spending is a direct tool used by a government to influence economic activity, which is the essence of fiscal policy.  [cite_start]Spending tools can include transfer payments, current spending, and capital spending. 
* [cite_start]**A is incorrect.** Open market operations are a tool used by a central bank to implement monetary policy. 
* [cite_start]**C is incorrect.** The policy rate (like the discount rate in the U.S. or the refinancing rate by the ECB) is a tool of monetary policy, set by the central bank to influence the quantity of money and credit.

A government's fiscal policy is considered expansionary when it involves:
- A) an increase in taxes and a decrease in spending.
- B) a decrease in a budget surplus.
- C) a decrease in a budget deficit.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct.** An expansionary fiscal policy is one that tends to increase GDP. [cite_start]A decrease in a budget surplus (or an increase in a deficit) signifies that the government is spending more relative to its revenue, which stimulates overall demand. 
* [cite_start]**A is incorrect.** An increase in taxes and a decrease in spending are components of a contractionary fiscal policy, designed to slow the economy. 
* [cite_start]**C is incorrect.** A decrease in a budget deficit (or an increase in a surplus) is considered a contractionary fiscal policy as it tends to decrease GDP.

[cite_start]During a recession, unemployment insurance payments automatically increase, which helps to support aggregate demand. 
* [cite_start]**A is incorrect.** Discretionary fiscal policy refers to intentional spending and taxing decisions made by a government to stabilize the economy. 
* [cite_start]**C is incorrect.** Increased spending on unemployment benefits is expansionary, not contractionary, as it increases the budget deficit and supports aggregate demand.

Assuming a tax rate of 20% and a marginal propensity to consume (MPC) of 0.90, the fiscal multiplier is *closest* to:
- A) 2.65
- B) 3.57
- C) 5.00

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* [cite_start]**B is correct.** The formula for the fiscal multiplier is $1 / [1 - MPC(1 - t)]$, where MPC is the marginal propensity to consume and t is the tax rate. 
    * Multiplier = $1 / [1 - 0.90(1 - 0.20)]$
    * Multiplier = $1 / [1 - 0.90(0.80)]$
    * Multiplier = $1 / [1 - 0.72]$
    * Multiplier = $1 / 0.28 \approx 3.57$
* **A is incorrect.** This would be closer to the result with a lower MPC or higher tax rate.
* **C is incorrect.** This would be the multiplier if the tax rate were zero ($1 / (1 - 0.8)$) or if the MPC was lower with a different tax rate. A multiplier of 5.00 corresponds to an MPC of 0.8 with a zero tax rate.

If a government implements an expansionary fiscal policy while the central bank pursues a contractionary monetary policy, the most likely outcome is:
- A) lower interest rates and a contraction of the private sector.
- B) higher interest rates and an increase in government spending as a proportion of GDP.
- C) lower aggregate demand and lower interest rates.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct.** Expansionary fiscal policy (e.g., increased government borrowing) puts upward pressure on interest rates, and a contractionary monetary policy also leads to higher interest rates. Therefore, interest rates will be higher. [cite_start]The expansionary fiscal policy means government spending will increase as a proportion of GDP. 
* **A is incorrect.** Interest rates would rise, not fall, from the combination of increased government borrowing and tight monetary policy.
* [cite_start]**C is incorrect.** Aggregate demand will likely be higher due to the fiscal stimulus, even with the restrictive monetary policy, and interest rates would be higher, not lower.

The crowding-out effect suggests that increased government borrowing to fund a budget deficit will most likely:
- A) increase private investment by boosting investor confidence.
- B) have no effect on private investment due to Ricardian equivalence.
- C) decrease private investment by causing interest rates to rise.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

* [cite_start]**C is correct.** The crowding-out effect posits that increased government borrowing increases interest rates, which in turn reduces borrowing and investment by the private sector.  [cite_start]Government borrowing effectively takes the place of private-sector borrowing. 
* **A is incorrect.** The crowding-out effect describes a negative impact on private investment, not a positive one.
* **B is incorrect.** This describes Ricardian equivalence, which is a different theory. [cite_start]The crowding-out effect specifically relates to the impact of government borrowing on interest rates and private investment.

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

* [cite_start]**C is correct.** If the real interest rate on a government's debt is higher than the real growth rate of its economy, the debt ratio will increase over time, assuming tax rates remain constant.  The cost of servicing the debt outpaces the growth in the tax base (GDP).
* [cite_start]**A is incorrect.** If the real interest rate on the debt is lower than the real growth rate of GDP, the debt ratio will decrease over time. 
* **B is incorrect.** If the rates are equal, the debt ratio would likely stabilize, not necessarily increase (assuming a balanced primary budget). The condition for an increase is the interest rate exceeding the growth rate.

- C) A reduction in taxes for all income levels.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* [cite_start]**B is correct.** Spending tools, such as direct government purchases, are generally considered the most effective in increasing aggregate demand because the entire amount is injected into the economy. 
* **A is incorrect.** Tax reductions for high-income earners are less effective because individuals with higher incomes have a lower marginal propensity to consume (MPC) and are likely to save a larger portion of the tax cut.
* [cite_start]**C is incorrect.** While general tax reductions are more effective than those targeted at high-income earners, they are still considered less effective than direct government spending because a portion of the tax savings will be saved rather than spent.  [cite_start]Tax reductions for those with low incomes are more effective than those for high incomes because of a higher MPC.

- C) an increase in interest rates.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

* [cite_start]**A is correct.** With contractionary fiscal policy, government spending as a proportion of GDP will decrease.  [cite_start]Simultaneously, expansionary monetary policy will lower interest rates, stimulating private consumption and investment.  [cite_start]The combination leads to a larger private sector relative to the public sector. 
* **B is incorrect.** The effect on aggregate demand is ambiguous; contractionary fiscal policy reduces it, while expansionary monetary policy increases it. The net effect is not certain.
* [cite_start]**C is incorrect.** Interest rates will fall due to decreased government borrowing (from contractionary fiscal policy) and the expansion of the money supply (from expansionary monetary policy).

According to the concept of Ricardian equivalence, a government budget deficit created by a tax cut will:
- A) significantly increase aggregate demand because of the fiscal multiplier effect.
- B) have no effect on aggregate demand because private savings will increase to offset the deficit.
- C) significantly decrease aggregate demand because taxpayers anticipate higher future interest rates.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct.** Ricardian equivalence posits that taxpayers anticipate that a current budget deficit must be paid for with higher future taxes. [cite_start]In response, they will increase their current savings (and reduce current consumption) by an amount sufficient to cover that future tax liability.  [cite_start]If this holds, the increase in private savings exactly offsets the government deficit, resulting in no net change to aggregate demand. 
* **A is incorrect.** This describes the traditional Keynesian view, which Ricardian equivalence directly contradicts.
* **C is incorrect.** Ricardian equivalence focuses on the savings response to future tax liabilities, not on a reaction to interest rates that would decrease aggregate demand. It predicts no change in aggregate demand.

- C) expansionary, as the spending multiplier effect is larger than the tax multiplier effect.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

* **C is correct.** This scenario describes the balanced budget multiplier. [cite_start]An increase in government spending directly increases aggregate demand by the full amount.  [cite_start]However, a tax increase of the same amount reduces disposable income, and the initial reduction in spending is only a fraction of the tax increase, determined by the marginal propensity to consume (MPC).  [cite_start]Because the initial spending increase ($200M) is larger than the initial spending decrease ($200M x MPC), the net effect on aggregate demand is positive and expansionary. 
* **A is incorrect.** The effects do not perfectly cancel out. [cite_start]The multiplier for government spending is greater than the multiplier for taxes. 
* **B is incorrect.** The spending multiplier is larger than the tax multiplier, leading to an expansionary effect.

An economy is in a deep recession. Its government reports a large budget deficit. To determine whether the government's fiscal policy is actively expansionary, an analyst should examine the:
- A) total value of outstanding government debt.
- B) change in the structural budget deficit.
- C) reported headline budget deficit.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* [cite_start]**B is correct.** The headline budget deficit is influenced by automatic stabilizers; a deficit will naturally increase during a recession due to lower tax receipts and higher transfer payments.  [cite_start]To gauge the discretionary stance of fiscal policy, economists use the structural (or cyclically adjusted) budget deficit, which is the deficit that would occur if the economy were at full employment under current policies.  An increase in the structural deficit would indicate an actively expansionary policy.
* **A is incorrect.** The total stock of debt is a result of past deficits and does not indicate the stance of current fiscal policy.
* [cite_start]**C is incorrect.** The headline budget deficit is misleading because it includes the effects of automatic stabilizers, making it difficult to separate the impact of discretionary policy from the state of the business cycle.

A government enacts an expansionary fiscal policy to combat a recession. However, the recession is primarily caused by a widespread shortage of skilled labor and raw materials. The most likely result of this policy will be:
- A) a successful increase in real GDP with stable prices.
- B) a failure to increase real GDP and a rise in inflation.
- C) a decrease in interest rates and a rise in private investment.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct.** Fiscal policy is a tool for managing aggregate demand. [cite_start]If an economic slowdown is caused by supply-side issues, such as resource constraints (supply shortages), an expansionary fiscal policy that boosts demand will be ineffective at increasing output.  [cite_start]Instead, the increased demand pressing against constrained supply will lead to higher inflation. 
* **A is incorrect.** The policy will not be successful in increasing real GDP because the economy is constrained by supply, not a lack of demand.
* **C is incorrect.** An expansionary fiscal policy typically involves increased government borrowing, which leads to higher, not lower, interest rates and would tend to crowd out private investment.
