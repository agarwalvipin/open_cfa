</details>

Which of the following is *least likely* considered a primary function of the foreign exchange market?
- A) To facilitate international trade and investment.
- B) To transfer purchasing power from one currency to another.
- C) To set monetary policy for central banks.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

* **C is correct.** The foreign exchange market reacts to monetary policy, but it does not set it. Central banks set their own monetary policy (e.g., interest rate targets), and these actions influence currency values in the FX market.
* *A is incorrect* because a core function of the FX market is to provide the mechanism for converting currencies, which is essential for companies to conduct business and make investments across borders.
* *B is incorrect* because converting one currency to another is the fundamental definition of transferring purchasing power. For example, selling USD to buy EUR transfers purchasing power from the U.S. to the Eurozone.

An exchange rate quote of 1.2500 USD/GBP from the perspective of a UK-based investor is a(n):
- A) Direct quote.
- B) Indirect quote.
- C) Cross-rate quote.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct.** An indirect quote is the amount of foreign currency that can be purchased for one unit of the domestic currency (FC/DC). For a UK-based investor, the domestic currency is the British Pound (GBP). The quote 1.2500 USD/GBP shows how many units of foreign currency (USD) can be acquired for one unit of their domestic currency (GBP).
* *A is incorrect* because a direct quote would state the price of one unit of the foreign currency in terms of the domestic currency (DC/FC). For a UK investor, a direct quote for the USD would be presented as GBP/USD (e.g., 0.8000 GBP/USD).
* *C is incorrect* because a cross-rate is an exchange rate between two currencies that is derived from their individual exchange rates with a common third currency.

</details>

The exchange rate for the Swiss Franc (CHF) against the US Dollar (USD) moves from 0.9200 CHF/USD to 0.9000 CHF/USD. The US Dollar has:
- A) Depreciated by 2.22% against the CHF.
- B) Appreciated by 2.22% against the CHF.
- C) Depreciated by 2.17% against the CHF.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

* **C is correct.** The quote is CHF/USD, which is the price of the USD in terms of CHF. The value of the USD has decreased from 0.9200 CHF to 0.9000 CHF, meaning the USD has depreciated.
    The percentage change is calculated as:
    (Ending Rate - Beginning Rate) / Beginning Rate = (0.9000 - 0.9200) / 0.9200 = -0.021739 or -2.17%.
* *A is incorrect.* This calculates the appreciation of the CHF against the USD. The question asks about the USD. To calculate the change in the CHF, we would first need to invert the quotes: 1/0.9200 = 1.0870 USD/CHF and 1/0.9000 = 1.1111 USD/CHF. The appreciation of the CHF is (1.1111 - 1.0870) / 1.0870 = 2.22%.
* *B is incorrect.* The USD has clearly depreciated, not appreciated, as it buys fewer CHF.

Which of the following is a component of a country's current account?
- A) Foreign direct investment.
- B) Unilateral transfers.
- C) Portfolio investment.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct.** The current account includes the balance of trade in goods and services, net income from abroad, and net unilateral transfers (e.g., foreign aid, remittances).
* *A is incorrect.* Foreign direct investment (FDI) is a component of the financial account (or capital and financial account), as it represents the acquisition of controlling interests in foreign assets.
* *C is incorrect.* Portfolio investment, which includes buying and selling of foreign stocks and bonds without a controlling interest, is also a component of the financial account.

- A) Discount.
- B) Premium.
- C) Parity.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct.** The forward rate (1.1550) is higher than the spot rate (1.1500). This means the base currency (EUR) is trading at a forward premium relative to the price currency (USD). It takes more USD to buy one EUR in the forward market than in the spot market.
* *A is incorrect.* The EUR would be at a forward discount if the forward rate were lower than the spot rate.
* *C is incorrect.* Parity would imply the forward and spot rates are equal.

A country that pegs its currency to another currency or a basket of currencies is operating under which type of exchange rate regime?
- A) Floating exchange rate.
- B) Fixed exchange rate.
- C) Managed float.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct.** A fixed exchange rate regime is characterized by a country's monetary authority pegging its currency's value to another currency, a basket of currencies, or a commodity like gold.
* *A is incorrect.* In a floating exchange rate regime, the currency's value is determined by market forces of supply and demand without government intervention.
* *C is incorrect.* A managed float is a hybrid system where the currency is generally allowed to float, but the central bank intervenes periodically to influence the rate.

</details>

The monetary approach to exchange rate determination *most likely* suggests that a country with a higher rate of money supply growth relative to its trading partners will experience:
- A) Currency appreciation.
- B) Currency depreciation.
- C) No change in its currency's value.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct.** According to the monetary approach, money is like any other good. An increase in its supply (higher money growth) relative to its demand leads to a decrease in its price (value). Therefore, a country with a higher rate of money supply growth will likely see its currency depreciate.
* *A is incorrect.* Currency appreciation would be expected if the money supply were growing more slowly than in other countries, making the currency relatively scarcer.
* *C is incorrect.* A change in the relative money supply is expected to have a direct impact on the currency's value under this approach.

An analyst is given the following quotes:
* USD/EUR: 1.1000 / 1.1050
* GBP/USD: 1.3000 / 1.3100

The bid-ask spread for the GBP/EUR cross-rate is *closest* to:
- A) 1.4300 / 1.4497
- B) 0.6949 / 0.7042
- C) 1.4300 / 1.4365

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

* **A is correct.** To calculate the GBP/EUR cross-rate, we need to multiply the two quotes: (GBP/USD) Ã— (USD/EUR).
    * **To find the bid for GBP/EUR (the rate at which a dealer buys EUR with GBP):** You will sell EUR, so you use the bid rates for both quotes. Bid(GBP/EUR) = Bid(GBP/USD) Ã— Bid(USD/EUR) = 1.3000 Ã— 1.1000 = 1.4300.
    * **To find the ask for GBP/EUR (the rate at which a dealer sells EUR for GBP):** You will buy EUR, so you use the ask rates for both quotes. Ask(GBP/EUR) = Ask(GBP/USD) Ã— Ask(USD/EUR) = 1.3100 Ã— 1.1050 = 1.44955, which rounds to 1.4496 or 1.4497 depending on convention.
    * The resulting bid-ask quote is 1.4300 / 1.4497.
* *B is incorrect.* This would be the calculation for the EUR/GBP rate, which requires inverting the quotes.
* *C is incorrect.* This incorrectly mixes the bid and ask calculations.

The spot exchange rate for CAD/USD is 1.3500. The risk-free interest rate in Canada is 4.0% and in the United States is 5.0%. The 1-year forward CAD/USD rate based on interest rate parity is *closest* to:
- A) 1.3371
- B) 1.3631
- C) 1.3500

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

* **A is correct.** The interest rate parity formula is:
    $Forward = Spot \times \frac{(1 + i_{price})}{(1 + i_{base})}$
    In the CAD/USD quote, the price currency is CAD and the base currency is USD.
    * $i_{price}$ = Canadian interest rate = 4.0%
    * $i_{base}$ = U.S. interest rate = 5.0%
    * Spot = 1.3500
    Forward = $1.3500 \times \frac{(1 + 0.04)}{(1 + 0.05)} = 1.3500 \times \frac{1.04}{1.05} = 1.33714$
* *B is incorrect.* This result is obtained by incorrectly inverting the interest rate ratio.
* *C is incorrect.* The forward rate will differ from the spot rate if the interest rates in the two countries are different.

A country with a persistent current account deficit is *most likely* to experience:
- A) An appreciating currency due to strong investment inflows.
- B) A depreciating currency due to an excess supply of its currency in foreign markets.
- C) A balanced financial account that perfectly offsets the deficit without currency effects.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct.** A current account deficit implies that a country is importing more goods, services, and income than it is exporting. To pay for these excess imports, the country must supply its currency to the foreign exchange market to buy foreign currency. This excess supply puts downward pressure on the currency's value, leading to depreciation, all else being equal.
* *A is incorrect.* While strong investment inflows (a financial account surplus) can lead to appreciation and are necessary to fund a current account deficit, the deficit itself creates depreciation pressure. The net effect depends on the relative magnitudes, but the most direct impact of the current account deficit is downward pressure.
* *C is incorrect.* While in theory the BOP must balance to zero, this balance is achieved through exchange rate adjustments or central bank intervention. A financial account surplus is required to offset a current account deficit, but this process has significant implications for the currency's value.

According to the Mundell-Fleming model, under a floating exchange rate regime with high capital mobility, expansionary fiscal policy will *most likely* lead to:
- A) An increase in net exports.
- B) A depreciation of the domestic currency.
- C) An appreciation of the domestic currency.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

* **C is correct.** In the Mundell-Fleming model with a floating exchange rate and high capital mobility:
    1.  Expansionary fiscal policy (e.g., increased government spending) stimulates the economy and pushes domestic interest rates up.
    2.  Higher interest rates attract foreign capital inflows.
    3.  These inflows increase the demand for the domestic currency, causing it to appreciate.
    4.  The currency appreciation makes exports more expensive and imports cheaper, causing net exports to decrease, which crowds out the initial fiscal stimulus.
* *A is incorrect.* Net exports will decrease, not increase, due to the currency appreciation.
* *B is incorrect.* The currency will appreciate, not depreciate, due to capital inflows seeking higher interest rates.

According to the Mundell-Fleming model, under a fixed exchange rate regime, a central bank's attempt to conduct an independent, expansionary monetary policy will *most likely* be:
- A) Highly effective at increasing aggregate demand.
- B) Ineffective, as the central bank must reverse the policy to defend the peg.
- C) Effective only if capital mobility is low.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct.** Under a fixed exchange rate regime, the central bank is committed to maintaining the currency's value.
    1.  An attempt at expansionary monetary policy (e.g., buying bonds to increase the money supply) would lower domestic interest rates.
    2.  Lower interest rates would lead to capital outflows as investors seek higher returns elsewhere.
    3.  These outflows would put downward pressure on the domestic currency.
    4.  To defend the fixed exchange rate (the peg), the central bank must intervene by buying its own currency in the FX market, which it does by selling foreign reserves. This action decreases the domestic money supply, completely offsetting the initial expansionary policy. Therefore, independent monetary policy is ineffective.
* *A is incorrect.* The policy is ineffective because it must be reversed to maintain the peg.
* *C is incorrect.* While the pressure might be less with low capital mobility, the central bank is still ultimately constrained by the need to defend the peg. The core conclusion is that monetary policy is ineffective under a fixed regime.

The asset market approach to exchange rate determination is *least likely* to consider which of the following factors?
- A) The current account balance.
- B) The relative supply of domestic bonds.
- C) The expected future exchange rate.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

* **A is correct.** The asset market approach posits that exchange rates adjust to balance the supply and demand for financial assets (stocks, bonds). While the portfolio balance version of this approach does incorporate the current account, the pure asset market approach emphasizes capital flows driven by factors like interest rate differentials and expected changes in exchange rates, rather than the slow-moving trade flows in the current account. Compared to B and C, A is the least emphasized factor.
* *B is incorrect.* The portfolio balance approach, a subset of the asset market approach, explicitly considers the relative supply and demand for a full range of assets, including domestic and foreign bonds.
* *C is incorrect.* Expectations about future exchange rates are a critical component of the asset market approach, as they influence the expected returns on holding foreign assets.

- A) Expansionary fiscal policy.
- B) Expansionary monetary policy.
- C) A combination of contractionary fiscal and expansionary monetary policy.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct.** According to the Mundell-Fleming model, under a floating exchange rate and high capital mobility, monetary policy is highly effective. Expansionary monetary policy leads to lower interest rates, which causes capital outflows and a depreciation of the domestic currency. This depreciation boosts net exports, reinforcing the initial stimulus and increasing aggregate income.
* *A is incorrect.* As explained in a previous question, expansionary fiscal policy leads to higher interest rates and currency appreciation, which crowds out net exports, making the policy largely ineffective at changing aggregate income.
* *C is incorrect.* While the expansionary monetary policy component is effective, a contractionary fiscal policy would work in the opposite direction, dampening aggregate income.

A sudden increase in the perceived riskiness of investing in a country would *least likely* lead to:
- A) A deficit in the country's financial account.
- B) Downward pressure on the country's currency.
- C) A surplus in the country's current account.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

* **C is correct.** An increase in perceived risk would trigger capital flight (a financial account deficit) and cause the currency to depreciate. While a depreciated currency would eventually make exports cheaper and imports more expensive, leading to an improvement in the current account, this is a longer-term adjustment. The immediate effect is on the financial account and the currency value, not an instantaneous surplus in the current account. Therefore, a current account surplus is the least likely immediate outcome.
* *A is incorrect.* Increased risk perception would cause both foreign and domestic investors to sell the country's assets, leading to a capital outflow and a deficit in the financial account.
* *B is incorrect.* Capital outflows mean investors are selling the domestic currency to buy foreign currencies, which puts significant downward pressure on the domestic currency's value.

A country with a fixed exchange rate and high capital mobility wishes to stimulate its economy. Its policymakers choose to devalue the currency. This action is *most likely* to be successful if:
- A) It is accompanied by expansionary fiscal policy.
- B) It is accompanied by expansionary monetary policy.
- C) The country's trading partners immediately devalue their currencies as well.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct.** A devaluation under a fixed regime makes the country's exports cheaper, stimulating net exports and aggregate demand. However, this increase in income will also increase the demand for money, putting upward pressure on interest rates and the currency. To prevent the currency from immediately re-appreciating back to its old peg, the central bank must engage in expansionary monetary policy (increase the money supply) to keep interest rates down and validate the new, lower exchange rate.
* *A is incorrect.* Expansionary fiscal policy would increase interest rates, creating appreciation pressure that would counteract the devaluation.
* *C is incorrect.* If trading partners also devalue, the initial competitive advantage gained by the devaluation would be erased, rendering the policy ineffective.

Under a floating exchange rate regime with low capital mobility, the effect of an expansionary monetary policy is *least likely* to involve:
- A) A significant depreciation of the currency driven by capital outflows.
- B) An increase in net exports.
- C) A decrease in domestic interest rates.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

* **A is correct.** With low capital mobility, the link between interest rates and international capital flows is weak. While expansionary monetary policy will lower domestic interest rates, it will not trigger large capital outflows. The currency will still depreciate, but this depreciation will be driven more by the trade channel (higher income leading to higher imports) than by a massive capital account reversal. Therefore, a depreciation driven by *significant capital outflows* is the least likely channel of transmission. The policy is still effective, but the mechanism is different than with high capital mobility.
* *B is incorrect.* The policy will lead to currency depreciation (through the trade and a muted capital channel), which will stimulate net exports.
* *C is incorrect.* The initial step of an expansionary monetary policy is to lower domestic interest rates to stimulate investment and consumption.

- B) An expansionary monetary policy.
- C) A revaluation of the currency.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct.** This scenario demonstrates how fiscal policy gains potency under a fixed regime.
    1.  Expansionary fiscal policy raises domestic income and money demand, pushing interest rates up.
    2.  With high capital mobility, the higher interest rates attract significant capital inflows.
    3.  These inflows create strong upward pressure on the currency (appreciation pressure).
    4.  To defend the peg and prevent appreciation, the central bank must intervene by selling its own currency and buying foreign assets. This action increases the domestic money supply.
    5.  This increase in the money supply is an expansionary monetary policy, which accommodates the fiscal stimulus and further boosts aggregate demand.
* *A is incorrect.* A contractionary policy would involve selling foreign assets to shrink the money supply, which would exacerbate the upward pressure on interest rates and the currency.
* *C is incorrect.* A revaluation is a policy choice to change the peg, not an action to defend the existing one. The pressure is for appreciation, and the central bank's job is to resist it.

Which of the following relationships is *most* accurate? A surplus in a country's financial account must be met with:
- A) A surplus in the country's current account.
- B) A deficit in the country's current account, assuming the official reserve account is unchanged.
- C) A depreciation of the country's currency.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct.** The balance of payments must, by definition, sum to zero. The basic identity is:
    Current Account (CA) + Financial Account (FA) + Official Reserve Account (ORA) = 0.
    Assuming no change in the official reserve account (ORA = 0), the identity simplifies to CA + FA = 0, or CA = -FA. Therefore, a surplus in the financial account (FA > 0) must be offset by a deficit in the current account (CA < 0). A financial account surplus means the country is a net borrower from the rest of the world, and this borrowing finances a current account deficit (i.e., importing more than it exports).
* *A is incorrect.* A surplus in both accounts would violate the fundamental BOP identity.
* *C is incorrect.* A surplus in the financial account means there are net capital inflows, which increases demand for the domestic currency and leads to appreciation, not depreciation.

</details>

According to the portfolio balance approach to exchange rate determination, if a government runs a large budget deficit financed by selling bonds to domestic investors, the *most likely* immediate impact is:
- A) Currency depreciation due to a decrease in the domestic money supply.
- B) Currency appreciation due to higher domestic interest rates.
- C) Currency depreciation due to an increase in the supply of domestic bonds.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct.** The portfolio balance approach is an extension of the asset market approach. When the government sells bonds to finance a deficit, it increases the supply of domestic bonds.
    1.  To entice domestic investors to hold this larger supply of bonds in their portfolios, the price of these bonds must fall, which means their yield (interest rate) must rise.
    2.  These higher domestic interest rates will attract capital from foreign investors seeking higher returns.
    3.  The resulting capital inflows increase the demand for the domestic currency, causing it to appreciate.
* *A is incorrect.* The money supply does not necessarily decrease; the government is exchanging bonds for money from investors, not altering the monetary base itself (unlike central bank operations).
* *C is incorrect.* While the supply of domestic bonds does increase, this doesn't directly cause depreciation. The key mechanism is the change in the bonds' price/yield. The higher yield required to absorb the new supply leads to appreciation. A different version of this theory states that if this leads to expectations of future monetization (inflation), it could cause depreciation, but the most direct impact described is through interest rates.
