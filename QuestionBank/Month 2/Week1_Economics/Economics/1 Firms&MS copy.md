A firm operating in a perfectly competitive market should shut down in the short run if its total revenue is less than its:

- A) total costs.
- B) total fixed costs.
- C) total variable costs.


<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

* **C is correct** because in the short run, a firm must cover its variable costs to continue operating. If total revenue (TR) cannot even cover total variable costs (TVC), the firm's losses from operating would be greater than its fixed costs. By shutting down, the firm's loss is limited to its total fixed costs. Therefore, if TR < TVC (or equivalently, Price < Average Variable Cost), the firm should cease production in the short run. 
* **A is incorrect** because a firm might operate in the short run even if total revenue is less than total costs (i.e., it is making an economic loss). As long as TR covers TVC, it can contribute to paying some of the fixed costs. 
* **B is incorrect** because fixed costs must be paid in the short run whether the firm operates or shuts down. The shutdown decision is based on whether revenue can cover the variable costs of production.

Which of the following is a key characteristic of a perfectly competitive market?

- A) Firms have significant pricing power.
- B) Products are highly differentiated.
- C) Barriers to entry are very low.


<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

* **C is correct** because a defining feature of perfect competition is that barriers to entry into the market are very low, allowing new firms to easily enter and compete. 
* **A is incorrect** because firms in a perfectly competitive market are price takers, meaning they have no pricing power. The market price is determined by overall supply and demand. 
* **B is incorrect** because firms in perfect competition produce identical (homogeneous) products that are perfect substitutes for one another. Product differentiation is a characteristic of monopolistic competition and oligopoly.

An analyst wanting a simple measure of market concentration would most likely use the:

- A) Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI).
- B) N-firm concentration ratio.
- C) price-to-cost margin.


<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct** because the N-firm concentration ratio, which sums the market shares of the largest N firms, is described as a simple measure to calculate and understand for market concentration. 
* **A is incorrect** because the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) is more complex to calculate than the N-firm ratio as it involves squaring the market shares of the largest firms and then summing them. 
* **C is incorrect** because the price-to-cost margin is a measure of pricing power or profitability, not market concentration.

When a firm's long-run average total cost (LRATC) decreases as its scale of operations increases, the firm is experiencing:

- A) diseconomies of scale.
- B) constant returns to scale.
- C) economies of scale.


<details>

**Explanation:**

* **C is correct** because economies of scale (or increasing returns to scale) are present when the long-run average total cost decreases as production output increases. This is represented by the downward-sloping segment of the LRATC curve. 
* **A is incorrect** because diseconomies of scale occur when the LRATC increases as output increases, represented by the upward-sloping segment of the LRATC curve. 
* **B is incorrect** because constant returns to scale occur when LRATC remains constant over a range of output.

A firm in a monopolistically competitive market maximizes its profit by producing the quantity of output where:

- A) price equals marginal cost.
- B) average total cost is minimized.
- C) marginal revenue equals marginal cost.


<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

* **C is correct** because, like firms in other market structures, a firm in monopolistic competition maximizes its economic profits by producing at the quantity where marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC). 
* **A is incorrect** because in monopolistic competition, the firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve, which means price is greater than marginal revenue. Profit maximization occurs where MR=MC, so price will be greater than MC. 
* **B is incorrect** because the profit-maximizing output level does not necessarily coincide with the minimum point of the average total cost curve. In long-run equilibrium under monopolistic competition, the firm produces at a point where ATC is not at its minimum.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct** because the key feature of an oligopoly is the interdependence of firms. Since there are only a few firms, each must consider the actions and reactions of its competitors when making pricing and output decisions. 
* **A is incorrect** because products in an oligopoly can be either homogeneous (like oil) or differentiated (like automobiles). It is not the defining feature.

An agricultural firm that produces wheat and sells it in a large market where it has no control over the price is most likely operating in which market structure?

- A) Perfect competition
- B) Oligopoly
- C) Monopolistic competition

**Explanation:**

* **A is correct** because the market for a commodity like wheat, where many firms produce an identical product and no single firm can influence the market price, is a classic example of perfect competition. The firm is a price taker. 
* **B is incorrect** because firms in an oligopoly have some degree of pricing power and are interdependent.

Under monopolistic competition, firms differentiate their products primarily to:

- A) create high barriers to entry for new firms.
- B) achieve some degree of pricing power.
- C) form a cartel to maximize joint profits.


<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct** because by differentiating their products through quality, features, or marketing, firms create perceived differences in the minds of consumers. This gives them a downward-sloping demand curve and allows them some discretion in setting the price of their specific product. 
* **A is incorrect** because monopolistic competition is characterized by low barriers to entry. Product differentiation itself is not a high barrier. 
* **C is incorrect** because collusion (forming a cartel) is not feasible in monopolistic competition due to the large number of independent firms.

- B) a dominant firm strategy.
- C) collusion.


<details>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

* **C is correct** because collusion refers to an agreement among competitors to make joint decisions on pricing or output to increase their collective profits. A cartel is a formal collusive agreement. 
* **A is incorrect** because a Nash equilibrium is a situation where no firm can unilaterally improve its outcome by changing its strategy, given the other firms' strategies. It often results from competition, not cooperation. 
* **B is incorrect** because a dominant firm strategy applies to a specific model where one large firm sets the price and smaller firms follow. It is not a joint agreement among equals.

A company reports the following annual data:
- Total Revenue: $500,000
- Total Variable Costs: $400,000
- Total Fixed Costs: $150,000

Which of the following actions is most appropriate for the firm?

- A) Shut down in the short run and exit in the long run.
- B) Operate in the short run but exit in the long run.
- C) Operate in both the short run and the long run.


<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct**. First, compare Total Revenue (TR) to Total Variable Costs (TVC). Here, TR ($500,000) is greater than TVC ($400,000). This means the company is covering its variable costs and contributing $100,000 towards its fixed costs. Therefore, it should continue to operate in the short run to minimize losses. 
* Next, compare TR to Total Costs (TC). TC = TVC + TFC = $400,000 + $150,000 = $550,000. Since TR ($500,000) is less than TC ($550,000), the firm is making an economic loss. If this situation persists, the firm should shut down in the long run. 
* **A is incorrect** because the firm should operate in the short run as its revenue covers its variable costs.
* **C is incorrect** because the firm is making an economic loss and should not plan to operate in the long run under these conditions.

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct**.
* **Initial State:**
    * Firms: 40%, 20%, 20%, 15%, 5%
    * Top 4 firms: 40%, 20%, 20%, 15%
    * **Initial 4-firm concentration ratio** = 40 + 20 + 20 + 15 = 95%
    * **Initial HHI** = (0.40Â² + 0.20Â² + 0.20Â² + 0.15Â² + 0.05Â²) = 0.16 + 0.04 + 0.04 + 0.0225 + 0.0025 = 0.2650
* **Post-Merger State:**
    * The two firms with 20% share merge to create a new firm with a 40% share.
    * New market shares: 40%, 40%, 15%, 5%
    * Top 4 firms: 40%, 40%, 15%, 5%
    * **New 4-firm concentration ratio** = 40 + 40 + 15 + 5 = 100%
    * **New HHI** = (0.40Â² + 0.40Â² + 0.15Â² + 0.05Â²) = 0.16 + 0.16 + 0.0225 + 0.0025 = 0.3450
* **Conclusion:** The 4-firm concentration ratio increases from 95% to 100%. The HHI increases from 0.2650 to 0.3450. The HHI is generally more sensitive to mergers, especially among larger firms.

In the long run, a firm in a monopolistically competitive market will most likely produce at an output level where:

- A) economic profit is positive and price equals marginal cost.
- B) economic profit is zero and price equals average total cost.
- C) economic profit is zero and average total cost is at its minimum.


<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct** because low barriers to entry in monopolistic competition allow new firms to enter if existing firms are making economic profits. This entry of new firms shifts the demand curve for each individual firm down until price equals average total cost (P* = ATC*), at which point economic profit becomes zero. 
* **A is incorrect** because positive economic profits are competed away in the long run. Also, price is greater than marginal cost in monopolistic competition. 
* **C is incorrect** because in long-run equilibrium, a monopolistically competitive firm produces at a quantity where its average total cost is not at a minimum. This is a key difference from perfect competition and suggests the presence of excess capacity.

- B) match a price decrease but not a price increase.
- C) match both price increases and price decreases.


<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct**. The kinked demand curve model is built on the core assumption that rivals will not follow a price increase, causing the firm to lose market share (elastic demand), but will match a price decrease, leading to only a small gain in sales for all firms (inelastic demand). 
* **A is incorrect** because this is the opposite of the model's assumption. Competitors are assumed to ignore price increases to gain market share.
* **C is incorrect** because if competitors matched all price changes, the firm's demand curve would not have a "kink." The kink arises from the asymmetric response of competitors.

* **C is correct**. The breakeven point for any firm, regardless of market structure, is the point at which it earns zero economic profit. This occurs when total revenue (TR) exactly covers all costs, both fixed and variable, meaning TR = Total Cost (TC). 
* **A is incorrect**. When TR = TVC, the firm is at its short-run shutdown point, not its breakeven point. At this point, the firm's loss equals its total fixed costs.
* **B is incorrect**. The condition MR = MC determines the profit-maximizing level of output, not the breakeven point. A firm can be maximizing profit (or minimizing loss) and still be above or below its breakeven quantity.

Compared to a firm in perfect competition, a firm in long-run monopolistic competition equilibrium has excess capacity because it:

- A) produces a quantity greater than the level that minimizes average total cost.
- B) produces a quantity less than the level that minimizes average total cost.
- C) charges a price that is greater than marginal revenue.


<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct**. In long-run equilibrium, a monopolistically competitive firm produces at the output level where its downward-sloping demand curve is tangent to its average total cost (ATC) curve. This point is to the left of the minimum point of the ATC curve. The difference between this quantity and the quantity that would minimize ATC is known as excess capacity, suggesting an inefficient scale of production. 
* **A is incorrect**. Producing at a quantity greater than the ATC-minimizing level would mean the firm is in the region of diseconomies of scale, which is not characteristic of the long-run equilibrium.
* **C is incorrect**. While it is true that price is greater than marginal revenue, this fact explains why the firm is not allocatively efficient, but it does not directly define the concept of excess capacity, which relates to productive efficiency (producing at minimum ATC).

In the context of oligopoly pricing strategies, a Nash equilibrium is reached when:

- A) all firms in the cartel agree to a single price that maximizes industry profit.
- B) the dominant firm sets the price, and all other firms become price takers.
- C) each firm chooses its best strategy, given the strategies chosen by other firms.


<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

* **C is correct**. A Nash equilibrium is a concept from game theory where the outcome of a strategic game is stable because no player can unilaterally change their strategy to improve their own payoff. In an oligopoly, this means each firm has made its best pricing/output choice, assuming the other firms' choices remain constant. 
* **A is incorrect**. This describes a collusive or cartel agreement, which may not be a stable Nash equilibrium because individual firms often have an incentive to cheat on the agreement. 
* **B is incorrect**. This describes the outcome of the dominant firm model, which is one specific type of oligopoly model, not the general definition of a Nash equilibrium.

A limitation of both the N-firm concentration ratio and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index is that they:

- A) are too complex for regulators to use effectively.
- B) do not account for the degree of product differentiation.
- C) do not account for barriers to entry and potential competition.


<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

* **C is correct**. A significant limitation of simple concentration measures is that they do not consider barriers to entry. An industry might appear highly concentrated, but if barriers to entry are low, existing firms may have very little pricing power due to the threat of potential competition. 
* **A is incorrect**. The N-firm ratio is very simple to calculate, and the HHI is also straightforward, so complexity is not their main limitation.
* **B is incorrect**. While these measures don't directly quantify product differentiation, their main purpose is to measure concentration, not differentiation. The primary limitation highlighted in economic analysis is their failure to account for the competitive pressure from potential entrants.

A pharmaceutical company holds a patent that gives it the exclusive right to produce a life-saving drug. This market structure is best described as a monopoly primarily due to:

- A) economies of scale.
- B) government-granted protection.
- C) control over a key resource.


<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct** because patents and copyrights are forms of protection granted by the government. They create high barriers to entry, preventing other firms from producing the same product and thereby establishing a monopoly for the patent holder. 
* **A is incorrect** because while economies of scale can lead to a natural monopoly, the primary barrier in this case is the legal protection of the patent.
* **C is incorrect** because the key resource is the formula for the drug, which is protected by the patent (a government grant), rather than being a naturally occurring resource that the company physically controls.

An analyst is studying an industry with many firms, each holding a small market share. The firms compete heavily on advertising and product features, and it is relatively easy for new firms to enter. This industry is best classified as:

- A) perfect competition.
- B) monopolistic competition.
- C) oligopoly.


<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct**. The key characteristics describedâ€”many firms, low barriers to entry, and competition based on differentiated products (features and advertising)â€”are the defining features of monopolistic competition. 
* **A is incorrect** because perfect competition involves homogeneous products and no advertising. 
* **C is incorrect** because oligopoly involves only a few firms and high barriers to entry.

Which statement best describes pricing strategy in monopolistic competition versus perfect competition?

- A) Firms in both markets are price takers.
- B) Firms in monopolistic competition have some pricing power, while firms in perfect competition do not.
- C) Firms in perfect competition have some pricing power, while firms in monopolistic competition do not.


<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct**. Due to product differentiation, firms in monopolistic competition face a downward-sloping demand curve, giving them some control over the price they charge.  In contrast, firms in perfect competition produce identical products and face a perfectly elastic (horizontal) demand curve, making them price takers with no control over price. 
* **A is incorrect** because only firms in perfect competition are price takers.
* **C is incorrect** because it reverses the pricing power characteristics of the two market structures.

A firm is operating at a loss in the short run. It should continue to operate if its price per unit is:

- A) less than its average fixed cost.
- B) greater than its average variable cost.
- C) equal to its marginal cost.


<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct**. A firm making a loss should continue to operate in the short run as long as the price it receives per unit is greater than its average variable cost (AVC). This means its total revenue is covering its total variable costs, and the excess is contributing to paying its fixed costs, thus minimizing its overall loss. The loss would be greater (equal to total fixed costs) if it were to shut down. 
* **A is incorrect**. The relationship between price and average fixed cost is not the deciding factor for the short-run shutdown decision.
* **C is incorrect**. Producing where price equals marginal cost is the profit-maximizing (or loss-minimizing) rule for a perfectly competitive firm, but the decision to operate or shut down depends on whether the price at that quantity covers AVC.

</details>

Two firms, Firm A and Firm B, are the only producers in a market. They must decide whether to set a High Price or a Low Price. The payoff matrix below shows the profits for each firm (Profit A, Profit B).

| | Firm B: High Price | Firm B: Low Price |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Firm A: High Price** | ($100, $80) | ($50, $90) |
| **Firm A: Low Price** | ($110, $40) | ($70, $50) |

What is the Nash equilibrium for this game?

- A) Both firms charge a High Price.
- B) Firm A charges a Low Price, and Firm B charges a Low Price.
- C) Firm A charges a Low Price, and Firm B charges a High Price.


<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>


**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct**. A Nash equilibrium occurs when no player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their decision. We must check each of the four possible outcomes:
    1.  **(High, High):** If they are at (High, High), Firm A can get more profit by moving to Low Price ($110 > $100). So, this is not an equilibrium.
    2.  **(High, Low):** If they are at (High, Low), Firm A can get more profit by moving to Low Price ($70 > $50). So, this is not an equilibrium.
    3.  **(Low, High):** If they are at (Low, High), Firm B can get more profit by moving to Low Price ($50 > $40). So, this is not an equilibrium.
    4.  **(Low, Low):** If they are at (Low, Low), Firm A cannot get more profit by moving to High Price ($50 < $70). Firm B cannot get more profit by moving to High Price ($40 < $50). Since neither firm has an incentive to change its strategy, **(Low, Low) is the Nash Equilibrium**.

</details>

In the dominant firm model of oligopoly, the dominant firm's demand curve is derived by:

- A) summing the demand curves of the smaller competitive firms horizontally.
- B) subtracting the supply of the smaller competitive firms from the total market demand.
- C) finding the price where the dominant firm's marginal cost equals the total market demand.


<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct**. In the dominant firm model, the dominant firm (DF) sets the price, and the smaller competitive firms (CFs) act as price takers at that price. To determine its profit-maximizing output, the DF must estimate its own demand curve. It does this by taking the total market demand curve and subtracting the quantity that will be supplied by the smaller CFs at any given price. The residual demand is the DF's demand curve. 
* **A is incorrect**. Summing the demand curves of the smaller firms would not yield the dominant firm's demand.
* **C is incorrect**. The dominant firm determines its profit-maximizing quantity by setting its marginal cost equal to its *marginal revenue*, which is derived from its unique demand curve, not the total market demand.

Compared to the long-run equilibrium in perfect competition, the long-run equilibrium in monopolistic competition results in:

- A) higher output and a lower price.
- B) lower output and a higher price.
- C) the same output and price, but with advertising costs.


<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct**. In long-run equilibrium, a perfectly competitive firm produces at the minimum point of its average total cost (ATC) curve, where P = MC = min ATC. A monopolistically competitive firm produces where its demand curve is tangent to its ATC curve, which occurs at a lower quantity and a higher price than in perfect competition. This leads to both productive inefficiency (not producing at min ATC) and allocative inefficiency (Price > MC). 
* **A is incorrect**. Output is lower, not higher, and the price is higher, not lower.
* **C is incorrect**. Both the equilibrium price and quantity are different between the two market structures. The higher price and lower quantity in monopolistic competition are a result of product differentiation and the downward-sloping demand curve it creates.

A firm operating under imperfect competition maximizes profit by producing 1,000 units. At this output level, its total revenue is $80,000, its total variable cost is $60,000, and its total fixed cost is $30,000. Which of the following statements is most accurate?

- A) The firm is making an economic loss and should shut down immediately.
- B) The firm is making an economic loss but should continue to operate in the short run.
- C) The firm is past its breakeven point and is making a positive economic profit.


<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct**.
    1.  **Check for profit/loss:** Total Cost (TC) = Total Variable Cost (TVC) + Total Fixed Cost (TFC) = $60,000 + $30,000 = $90,000. Total Revenue (TR) is $80,000. Since TR < TC, the firm is making an economic loss of $10,000.
    2.  **Check the short-run shutdown condition:** The firm should operate in the short run if TR > TVC. Here, TR ($80,000) is greater than TVC ($60,000). By operating, the firm's loss is $10,000. If it were to shut down, its loss would be equal to its TFC of $30,000. Therefore, the firm minimizes its loss by continuing to operate in the short run. 
* **A is incorrect** because while the firm is making a loss, its revenue is sufficient to cover all of its variable costs and contribute to fixed costs, so it should not shut down in the short run.
* **C is incorrect** because the firm has not reached its breakeven point (where TR = TC) and is experiencing an economic loss, not a profit.

An industry's 3-firm concentration ratio is 90%. Which of the following statements is the most accurate conclusion an analyst can draw?

- A) The industry is a pure monopoly.
- B) The industry is highly concentrated, but firms may have limited pricing power if barriers to entry are low.
- C) The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) for this industry must be greater than 0.8100.


<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct**. A high N-firm concentration ratio indicates that a few firms dominate the market sales, which is a characteristic of an oligopoly. However, concentration ratios are a limited measure of market power. If barriers to entry are low, the threat of potential competition can constrain the pricing power of existing firms, even if the market appears concentrated. 
* **A is incorrect**. A 3-firm concentration ratio of 90% means there are at least three firms, so it cannot be a pure monopoly, which has only one firm.
* **C is incorrect**. The HHI could be much lower than 0.8100. For example, if the three firms each had a 30% market share, the HHI would be (0.3Â² + 0.3Â² + 0.3Â²) = 0.09 + 0.09 + 0.09 = 0.2700. The HHI is maximized if one firm has 90% and the others have 0%, which is not possible in a 3-firm scenario. For the HHI to be 0.8100, one firm would need a 90% market share (0.9Â² = 0.81), which would make the 1-firm concentration ratio 90%. We only know the 3-firm ratio is 90%.

A collusive agreement in an oligopoly market is more likely to be successful and sustainable if:

- A) there is a large number of firms in the cartel.
- B) the firms' products are highly differentiated.
- C) cheating by a member firm is easy to detect and punish.


<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

* **C is correct**. One of the key factors for the success of a cartel is the ability to enforce the agreement. If firms that cheat (e.g., by producing more than their quota or selling at a lower price) can be easily identified and effectively punished by other members, the incentive to cheat is reduced, and the collusive agreement is more likely to be sustained. 
* **A is incorrect**. Collusion is more successful when there are fewer firms. With a large number of firms, it becomes much more difficult to coordinate, monitor, and enforce an agreement. 
* **B is incorrect**. Collusion is easier to sustain when products are more similar (homogeneous). When products are highly differentiated, it is more difficult to agree on a single price or output allocation that satisfies all members.
