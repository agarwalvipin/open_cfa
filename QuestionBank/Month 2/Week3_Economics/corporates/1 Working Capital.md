Which of the following is best described as a primary source of liquidity?

- A) Renegotiating debt contracts.
- B) Selling fixed assets.
- C) Managing cash flows from operations.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

* **C is correct.** Primary sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated from a company's normal day-to-day business operations. This includes effective cash flow management, which is the core of a company's liquidity strategy.
* **A is incorrect.** Renegotiating debt contracts is a secondary source of liquidity, typically used when primary sources are insufficient. It signifies a deviation from normal operations and may indicate financial distress.
* **B is incorrect.** The sale of fixed assets is also a secondary source of liquidity. It involves liquidating long-term assets and is not part of a company's routine operations.

An analyst is evaluating the liquidity of a company. Which ratio would be the *most* appropriate initial measure to determine if the company can cover its short-term obligations with its short-term assets?

- A) Debt-to-equity ratio.
- B) Current ratio.
- C) Net profit margin.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct.** The current ratio (Current Assets / Current Liabilities) is a fundamental liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to pay off its short-term liabilities with its current assets.
* **A is incorrect.** The debt-to-equity ratio is a measure of solvency and leverage, not liquidity. It assesses long-term financial health.
* **C is incorrect.** Net profit margin is a profitability ratio, indicating how much profit is generated as a percentage of revenue. It does not directly measure liquidity.

Which of the following is *most likely* considered a drag on a company's liquidity?

- A) Early payment of payables.
- B) Obsolete inventory.
- C) A reduction in credit availability from a bank.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct.** A drag on liquidity occurs when receipts (cash inflows) are delayed. Obsolete inventory is difficult to sell, thus delaying the conversion of inventory to cash and tying up capital.
* **A is incorrect.** Early payment of payables is a pull on liquidity, as it accelerates cash outflows.
* **C is incorrect.** A reduction in credit availability is a pull on liquidity, as it requires the company to use its own cash reserves to make payments instead of relying on credit.

A negative cash conversion cycle (CCC) implies that a company:

- A) is taking longer to collect receivables than to pay its suppliers.
- B) has a critical liquidity problem.
- C) receives cash from customers before it needs to pay its suppliers.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

* **C is correct.** The cash conversion cycle measures the time between paying for inventory and receiving cash from its sale. A negative CCC indicates that the company sells its inventory and collects the cash from customers before it has to pay its suppliers for the inventory. This is a very efficient working capital position.
* **A is incorrect.** While collection and payment periods are part of the CCC, a negative cycle is a broader indicator of overall efficiency, not just a comparison between two components.
* **B is incorrect.** A negative CCC is a sign of high liquidity and strong working capital management, not a liquidity problem.

What is the primary trade-off a company faces when deciding whether to pay its suppliers early?

- A) Forgoing a potential early payment discount versus preserving cash.
- B) Building goodwill with suppliers versus increasing profitability.
- C) Improving its credit rating versus reducing its current liabilities.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

* **A is correct.** The central decision in payables management is whether the cost of forgoing a supplier's early payment discount is greater or less than the benefit of using that cash for other purposes (i.e., investing it) for a longer period.
* **B is incorrect.** While goodwill is a consideration, the primary financial trade-off is quantitative, revolving around the discount and the opportunity cost of cash.
* **C is incorrect.** Paying early reduces current liabilities but also cash, leaving the net impact on many liquidity ratios complex. The main driver of the decision is the cost of credit.

A company that shortens its cash conversion cycle by reducing its days sales outstanding (DSO) is *most likely* to have:

- A) lower profitability due to offering early payment discounts.
- B) increased the average time it takes to collect from customers.
- C) less cash invested in accounts receivable.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

* **C is correct.** Days sales outstanding (DSO) represents the average number of days it takes to collect revenue after a sale has been made. A reduction in DSO means the company is collecting cash from its customers more quickly, which reduces the amount of capital tied up in accounts receivable.
* **A is incorrect.** While offering discounts can reduce DSO, it's not the only method. Stricter credit policies could also be used. Therefore, lower profitability is not a guaranteed outcome.
* **B is incorrect.** Reducing DSO means the company has *decreased*, not increased, the average collection time.

When calculating the quick ratio, inventory is excluded from current assets because inventory is *most likely* to be:

- A) the most valuable current asset.
- B) the least liquid of the current assets.
- C) already pledged as collateral.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct.** The quick ratio (also known as the acid-test ratio) is a more stringent measure of liquidity than the current ratio. It excludes inventory because inventory is often the most difficult current asset to convert into cash quickly without a potential loss in value, especially in times of financial stress.
* **A is incorrect.** The value of inventory relative to other assets is not the reason for its exclusion; its lack of liquidity is the key factor.
* **C is incorrect.** While inventory can be pledged as collateral, this is not the primary reason for its universal exclusion from the quick ratio formula. The focus is on its inherent liquidity characteristics.

The formula for the Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) is:
$$ CCC = DOH + DSO - \text{Number of days of payables} $$

Plugging in the given values:
$$ CCC = 45 + 35 - 40 $$
$$ CCC = 80 - 40 = 40 \text{ days} $$

* **B is incorrect.** This is a defining feature of an uncommitted line; the bank can refuse to fund a request at its discretion.

A company reports the following financial data:
- Cash: $100,000
- Marketable Securities: $150,000
- Accounts Receivable: $200,000
- Annual Operating Expenses: $3,650,000
- Non-cash charges included in operating expenses: $300,000

The company's defensive interval ratio is *closest* to:

- A) 25.0 days.
- B) 27.4 days.
- C) 27.8 days.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

The Defensive Interval (DI) ratio measures how long a company can pay its daily cash expenses without relying on new cash inflows.

1.  **Calculate Daily Cash Expenditures:**
    $$ \text{Daily Cash Expenses} = \frac{\text{Annual Operating Expenses} - \text{Non-cash charges}}{365} $$
    $$ \text{Daily Cash Expenses} = \frac{\$3,650,000 - \$300,000}{365} = \frac{\$3,350,000}{365} = \$9,178.08 $$

2.  **Calculate the Defensive Interval:**
    $$ DI = \frac{\text{Cash} + \text{Marketable Securities} + \text{Accounts Receivable}}{\text{Daily Cash Expenses}} $$
    $$ DI = \frac{\$100,000 + \$150,000 + \$200,000}{\$9,178.08} = \frac{\$450,000}{\$9,178.08} = 27.78 \text{ days} $$

* **C is correct.** The defensive interval is approximately 27.8 days. Note that some versions of the formula use only Cash + Marketable Securities in the numerator. The core curriculum typically includes receivables. Be sure to know the specific formula provided in the curriculum. For this question, (Cash + Marketable Securities + Receivables) is used as it represents a common variant. A more conservative version would be (100k+150k)/9178.08 = 27.2 days, making B a strong distractor. The most common CFA curriculum definition includes receivables.

An aggressive approach to working capital management is *most likely* characterized by:

- B) financing permanent current assets with long-term debt.
- C) financing a high portion of current assets with short-term debt.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

* **C is correct.** An aggressive working capital policy prioritizes profitability over liquidity. This involves financing current assets, including permanent current assets, with higher levels of short-term, lower-cost, but riskier debt.
* **A is incorrect.** High levels of inventory and receivables describe an aggressive *investment* policy, but an aggressive *financing* policy is about the mix of debt used. Holding high levels of current assets is actually a conservative investment approach as it reduces shortages but hurts profitability.
* **B is incorrect.** Financing permanent current assets with long-term debt is a conservative (or maturity matching) approach, not an aggressive one.

A supplier offers a company credit terms of "2/10, net 40." The cost of not taking the discount and paying on the final day is *closest* to:

- A) 2.04%
- B) 24.8%
- C) 24.3%

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

The terms "2/10, net 40" mean the company gets a 2% discount if it pays within 10 days, otherwise the full amount is due in 40 days. By not taking the discount, the company is effectively borrowing the discounted amount for an additional 30 days (40 - 10).

The formula for the approximate annualized cost of trade credit is:
$$ \text{Cost} = \left(1 + \frac{\text{Discount}}{1 - \text{Discount}}\right)^{\frac{365}{\text{Days past discount}}} - 1 $$
$$ \text{Cost} = \left(1 + \frac{0.02}{1 - 0.02}\right)^{\frac{365}{40-10}} - 1 $$
$$ \text{Cost} = \left(1.0204\right)^{\frac{365}{30}} - 1 $$
$$ \text{Cost} = (1.0204)^{12.167} - 1 = 1.2774 - 1 = 0.2774 \text{ or } 27.74\% $$

* **B is correct.** Using the more accurate formula gives 27.74%. A commonly used simple approximation is `(Discount % / (1 - Discount %)) * (365 / Days beyond discount period)` which yields `(0.02 / 0.98) * (365 / 30) = 24.8%`. Given the options, the simpler formula is intended.

- B) A toy company that experiences significant seasonal spikes in demand.
- C) A grocery store with reliable, daily supplier deliveries.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct.** Just-in-time (JIT) systems are designed to minimize inventory holding costs by receiving inventory just as it is needed for production or sale. This requires a predictable demand pattern and reliable suppliers. A toy company with sharp, seasonal demand spikes would face a high risk of stockouts and lost sales under a JIT system, as it would be difficult to rapidly scale up inventory to meet the unpredictable surge.
* **A is incorrect.** A car manufacturer with a stable schedule is an ideal candidate for JIT.
* **C is incorrect.** A grocery store with reliable daily deliveries can effectively use JIT to manage perishable goods and reduce spoilage.

When investing surplus cash in short-term securities, a corporate treasurer is *most likely* to prioritize:

- A) maximizing the rate of return.
- B) securities with the longest maturity to lock in yields.
- C) safety and liquidity of the principal investment.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

* **C is correct.** The primary goal of managing short-term cash surpluses (the "cash" part of working capital) is to ensure the funds are available when needed and that the principal is not at risk. Therefore, safety and liquidity are the top priorities, even if it means accepting a lower yield. Typical investments include Treasury bills, commercial paper, and money market funds.
* **A is incorrect.** Maximizing return usually involves taking on more risk, which is contrary to the objectives of short-term cash management.
* **B is incorrect.** Investing in long-maturity securities introduces interest rate risk and reduces liquidity, which is inappropriate for managing short-term cash needs.

- A) Company A necessarily has poorer overall working capital management than Company B.
- B) Company B may have significant market power over its suppliers and customers.
- C) Company A is more profitable because it holds inventory for a longer period.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct.** A negative cash conversion cycle (-10 days) is a sign of extremely efficient working capital management. It implies the company collects cash from its customers before it has to pay its suppliers. This level of efficiency often stems from significant bargaining power, allowing the company to dictate favorable credit terms (e.g., short receivable periods and long payable periods).
* **A is incorrect.** While Company A's CCC is higher, this does not *necessarily* mean its management is poor. The optimal CCC can vary significantly by industry. For example, a luxury jeweler (Company A) will naturally have a much longer CCC than a large grocery chain (Company B). The comparison is only meaningful in context.
* **C is incorrect.** Holding inventory for a longer period increases holding costs and ties up capital, which generally hurts profitability. It does not lead to higher profits.

- C) Securing a long-term loan to refinance its short-term debt.

<details>

* **B is correct.** Filing for bankruptcy is an extreme secondary source of liquidity. While it can provide immediate relief from creditor claims and allow for restructuring, it is a sign of severe financial distress and not a sustainable operational strategy. It carries significant direct and indirect costs, including damage to reputation, which can impair long-term viability.
* **A is incorrect.** Implementing a more efficient inventory system is a primary liquidity strategy that improves operational cash flow and is a sustainable, long-term solution.

- B) a higher current ratio and lower risk of a liquidity crisis.
- C) a lower ratio of long-term financing to short-term financing.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct.** A conservative working capital policy prioritizes liquidity over profitability. It involves financing not only permanent current assets but also a portion of temporary current assets with long-term, higher-cost, but less risky debt. This increases the level of working capital, leading to a higher current ratio (Current Assets / Current Liabilities) and reducing the risk that the company cannot meet its short-term obligations.
* **A is incorrect.** A conservative policy leads to a *higher* current ratio and typically *lower* profitability due to higher interest costs on long-term debt and potentially higher carrying costs for holding more current assets.
* **C is incorrect.** A conservative policy involves using more long-term financing, which would lead to a *higher* ratio of long-term to short-term financing.

A company needs to borrow $5 million for 90 days. It has two options:

1.  A line of credit with a 0.5% commitment fee on the full line of $10 million and an interest rate of 4.0% on borrowed funds.
2.  Issue 90-day commercial paper with a total discount of $50,000 from face value and a dealer fee of $10,000.

The financing option with the lower annualized cost is:

- A) the line of credit.
- B) the commercial paper.
- C) both options have the same cost.

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

This question requires calculating the annualized cost of both options.

**1. Line of Credit Cost:**
* Interest on borrowed funds: $5,000,000 * 4.0% * (90/365) = $49,315
* Commitment fee: $10,000,000 * 0.5% = $50,000
    * Since the loan is for 90 days, we only consider the portion of the annual fee applicable to this period. However, commitment fees are typically charged on an annual basis for the privilege of the line, making the full fee part of the cost structure. A common CFA problem approach is to annualize all costs.
* Total cost for 90 days = Interest + Commitment Fee (pro-rated)
    * Let's annualize both components.
* Annualized Interest Cost: 4.0%
* Annualized Commitment Fee Cost: The fee is on the full line. Let's assume the commitment fee is an annualized rate applied to the full line amount. A better approach is to calculate the total dollar cost for the period and annualize it.
* Total Dollar Cost = Interest for 90 days + Commitment fee for 90 days
    * Interest = $49,315
    * Commitment Fee = $10,000,000 * 0.5% * (90/365) = $12,329
    * Total Cost = $49,315 + $12,329 = $61,644
* Annualized Rate = ($61,644 / $5,000,000) * (365/90) = 0.0123 * 4.056 = **5.00%**

**2. Commercial Paper Cost:**
* The company needs $5 million in proceeds. The face value will be slightly higher. However, the costs are given in dollars.
* Total Dollar Cost = Discount + Dealer Fee = $50,000 + $10,000 = $60,000
* Annualized Rate = (Total Cost / Amount Borrowed) * (365 / Days)
* Annualized Rate = ($60,000 / $5,000,000) * (365 / 90) = 0.012 * 4.056 = **4.87%**

**Conclusion:**
The commercial paper has an annualized cost of 4.87%, while the line of credit has an annualized cost of 5.00%. Therefore, the commercial paper is the cheaper option.

* **B is correct.**
