</details>

A company spent $50,000 on a feasibility study for a new project last year. This year, when deciding whether to undertake the project, how should this cost be treated?

- A) As an opportunity cost.
- B) As an initial cash outflow for the project.
- C) As a sunk cost.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

* **C is correct.** A sunk cost is a cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered. Capital budgeting decisions should be based on future incremental cash flows, and therefore, sunk costs should be ignored. The $50,000 was spent in the past and is irrelevant to the decision to move forward with the project.
* **A is incorrect.** An opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative that is foregone.
* **B is incorrect.** The feasibility study cost is not an incremental cash flow for the project decision being made today.

</details>

An analyst is using the payback period to evaluate a project that has an initial cost of $100,000. The project is expected to generate after-tax cash flows of $30,000 per year for 5 years. What is the project's payback period?

- A) 3.00 years.
- B) 3.33 years.
- C) 5.00 years.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct.** The payback period is the time it takes for a project's cumulative cash inflows to equal the initial investment.
    * After 3 years, cumulative cash flow is $30,000 * 3 = $90,000.
    * The remaining amount to be recovered is $100,000 - $90,000 = $10,000.
    * The time to recover the remaining amount is $10,000 / $30,000 = 0.33 years.
    * Total payback period = $3 + 0.33 = 3.33$ years.

- A) less than the cost of capital.
- B) equal to the cost of capital.
- C) greater than the cost of capital.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

* **C is correct.** For a conventional project, if the NPV is positive, it means the project is expected to earn a return greater than its cost. The IRR is the discount rate at which the NPV equals zero. Therefore, if the NPV is positive when discounted at the cost of capital, the IRR must be greater than the cost of capital.
* **A is incorrect.** If the IRR were less than the cost of capital, the NPV would be negative.
* **B is incorrect.** If the IRR were equal to the cost of capital, the NPV would be zero.

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

* **A is correct.** Simplicity in calculation and understanding is a primary **advantage** of the payback period, not a disadvantage.
* **B is incorrect.** The payback period is a significant disadvantage because it does not discount future cash flows, thus ignoring the time value of money.
* **C is incorrect.** The method's focus is solely on recovering the initial investment; it completely disregards any cash flows (and potential profits) that occur after the payback point has been reached, which is a major flaw.

- C) before tax and before financing costs.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct.** Capital budgeting decisions should be based on **after-tax cash flows**. Financing costs are reflected in the required rate of return (the discount rate), so they should not be deducted from the cash flows to avoid double-counting.
* **A is incorrect.** Taxes are a cash expense and must be considered. Including financing costs in the cash flows and the discount rate is a common error.

- B) Project B.
- C) The project with the shorter payback period.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

* **A is correct.** When NPV and IRR give conflicting rankings for mutually exclusive projects, the NPV decision should be followed. The NPV rule is theoretically superior because it directly measures the expected increase in firm value in dollar terms. The IRR reinvestment assumption (that cash flows are reinvested at the IRR) can be unrealistic.
* **B is incorrect.** Choosing the project with the higher IRR could lead to selecting a smaller project that adds less absolute value to the firm.
* **C is incorrect.** The payback period is not the primary decision criterion when NPV is available.

A project is expected to generate annual sales of $200,000 and have cash operating expenses of $120,000. The equipment will have annual depreciation of $30,000. If the company's tax rate is 25%, the project's annual after-tax operating cash flow is:

- A) $50,000.
- B) $67,500.
- C) $72,500.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct.** The after-tax operating cash flow (OCF) can be calculated as:
    $OCF = (\text{Sales} - \text{Cash Expenses} - \text{Depreciation})(1 - \text{Tax Rate}) + \text{Depreciation}$
    * EBT = $200,000 - $120,000 - $30,000 = $50,000
    * Taxes = $50,000 * 0.25 = $12,500
    * Net Operating Profit After Tax (NOPAT) = $50,000 - $12,500 = $37,500
    * OCF = NOPAT + Depreciation = $37,500 + $30,000 = $67,500

    Alternatively:
    $OCF = (\text{Sales} - \text{Cash Expenses})(1 - T) + (\text{Depreciation} \times T)$
    $OCF = ($200,000 - $120,000)(1 - 0.25) + ($30,000 \times 0.25)$
    $OCF = ($80,000)(0.75) + $7,500 = $60,000 + $7,500 = $67,500

* **A is incorrect.** The purchase price of the new equipment is a primary component of the initial outlay.
* **B is incorrect.** When replacing an old asset, the proceeds from selling it (on an after-tax basis) reduce the net initial cost of the new project. This is an incremental cash flow that must be included.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: A**

    * Taxable Gain on Sale = Salvage Value - Book Value = $35,000 - $20,000 = $15,000
    * Tax on Gain = $15,000 * 30% = $4,500
    * After-Tax Salvage Value = Salvage Value - Tax on Gain = $35,000 - $4,500 = $30,500
    * TNOCF = After-Tax Salvage Value + NWC Recovery = $30,500 + $15,000 = $45,500

**Explanation:**

* **C is correct.** The crossover rate is the specific discount rate at which the NPVs of two projects are equal. It is the point where their NPV profiles intersect. Below this rate, one project will have a higher NPV, and above this rate, the other project will have a higher NPV, which can lead to ranking conflicts between the NPV and IRR methods.
* **A is incorrect.** Each project has its own IRR, and these are generally not equal.
* **B is incorrect.** The rate at which a project's NPV is zero is its IRR, not the crossover rate.

If the cash flows are projected in real terms (i.e., they do not include an inflation component), then the appropriate discount rate is a real rate. Using a nominal rate (which includes an inflation premium) with real cash flows would understate the project's NPV.

- C) fact that IRR cannot be calculated for non-conventional cash flows.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct.** The conflict arises because the two methods make different assumptions about the rate at which intermediate cash flows can be reinvested. The NPV method implicitly assumes reinvestment at the cost of capital, which is generally more realistic. The IRR method assumes reinvestment at the project's own IRR, which can be overly optimistic for projects with high IRRs.
* **A is incorrect.** Both methods correctly ignore sunk costs.
* **C is incorrect.** While IRR can have issues with non-conventional cash flows (e.g., multiple IRRs), this is a flaw of the method itself, not the primary reason for ranking conflicts with NPV for projects that do have a unique IRR.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

* **C is correct.** When a firm has a fixed capital budget and cannot undertake all positive-NPV projects, the goal is to maximize the value generated per dollar of investment. The profitability index (PI) measures this by calculating the ratio of the present value of future cash flows to the initial investment. Prioritizing projects with the highest PI will lead to the combination of projects that yields the highest total NPV within the budget constraint.
* **A is incorrect.** Simply choosing the projects with the highest individual NPVs may not lead to the optimal outcome if those projects are very large and exhaust the budget, preventing the firm from taking several smaller, highly profitable projects.
* **B is incorrect.** IRR is a relative measure of return and does not account for the scale of the project.

A company is replacing an old machine that has a book value of $50,000 and can be sold today for $30,000. The new machine costs $150,000, and an additional $10,000 in shipping and installation is required. The replacement will cause the company's inventory to increase by $25,000. The company's tax rate is 30%. The initial investment outlay for this project is:

- A) $155,000.
- B) $161,000.
- C) $191,000.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

* **C is correct.** The calculation involves several components:
    1.  **Cost of New Machine**: $150,000 (price) + $10,000 (shipping/installation) = $160,000
    2.  **After-Tax Proceeds from Old Machine**:
        * Taxable Loss on Sale = Sale Price - Book Value = $30,000 - $50,000 = -$20,000
        * Tax Savings (Credit) from Loss = $20,000 * 30% = $6,000
        * After-Tax Proceeds = Sale Price + Tax Savings = $30,000 + $6,000 = $36,000
    3.  **Change in Net Working Capital**: Increase in inventory = $25,000
    4.  **Total Initial Outlay**:
        * Outlay = Cost of New Machine - After-Tax Proceeds from Old + Î”NWC
        * Outlay = $160,000 - $36,000 + $25,000 = $149,000.
        
Let's re-read the signs. Cost of new machine is an outflow. Shipping is an outflow. Increase in NWC is an outflow. Sale of old machine is an inflow. Tax savings from loss is an inflow.

Let's use the formula: Outlay = FCInv + NWCInv - Sal_Old + T(Sal_Old - B_Old)
* FCInv (Fixed Capital Investment) = $150,000 + $10,000 = $160,000
* NWCInv (Net Working Capital Investment) = $25,000
* Sal_Old (Salvage value of old) = $30,000
* B_Old (Book value of old) = $50,000
* T (Tax Rate) = 30%

Outlay = $160,000 + $25,000 - $30,000 + 0.30($30,000 - $50,000)
Outlay = $185,000 - $30,000 + 0.30(-$20,000)
Outlay = $155,000 - $6,000 = $149,000.

Ah, my provided answers are wrong. Let's re-calculate and provide correct options. Let's assume the question meant a tax on a gain instead of a credit on a loss for one of the options. What if the salvage was $60,000? Gain = 10k, Tax = 3k, After-tax salvage = 57k. Outlay = 160k - 57k + 25k = 128k. What if BV was $20k? Gain = 10k, Tax = 3k, After-tax salvage = 27k. Outlay = 160k - 27k + 25k = 158k.

Let me correct the question's answer and options.
Let's stick to the original question values and fix the answer.
Outlay = $160,000 (outflow) + $25,000 (outflow) - $30,000 (inflow from sale) - $6,000 (inflow from tax credit) = $149,000.

Let's adjust the numbers in the question to match one of the answers.
Let's target C) $191,000.
Outlay = FCInv + NWCInv - Sal_Old + T(Sal_Old - B_Old)
$191,000 = ($150,000 + $10,000) + NWCInv - Sal_Old + T(Sal_Old - B_Old)
This is getting complicated. Let's re-evaluate the common way of thinking about it.

Outflows:
- New Machine Cost: $150,000
- Shipping/Installation: $10,000
- Increase in Inventory (Î”NWC): $25,000
- Total Outflows = $185,000

Inflows:
- Sale of Old Machine: $30,000
- Tax Savings on Loss: (Book Value $50,000 - Sale Price $30,000) * 30% = $20,000 * 0.30 = $6,000
- Total Inflows = $36,000

Net Initial Outlay = Total Outflows - Total Inflows = $185,000 - $36,000 = $149,000.

It seems all the initial answer choices were incorrect. I will fix the answer choices and the explanation.

**Corrected Options:**
A) $149,000
B) $155,000
C) $185,000

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:**
* **A is correct.** The initial investment outlay is the net cash outflow at the beginning of the project.
    1.  **Cost of New Asset**: Price + Shipping = $150,000 + $10,000 = $160,000 (outflow).
    2.  **Investment in Net Working Capital**: Increase in inventory = $25,000 (outflow).
    3.  **After-Tax Proceeds from Sale of Old Asset**:
        * Capital Loss on Sale = Sale Price - Book Value = $30,000 - $50,000 = -$20,000.
        * This loss creates a tax shield (cash inflow): $20,000 Ã— 30% = $6,000.
        * Total cash inflow from selling the old asset = Sale Price + Tax Shield = $30,000 + $6,000 = $36,000.
    4.  **Net Initial Outlay** = (Cost of New Asset + Î”NWC) - After-Tax Proceeds from Old = ($160,000 + $25,000) - $36,000 = $185,000 - $36,000 = $149,000.

- **question_type**: mcq
- **difficulty**: hard
- **tags**: [Inflation, NPV]
</details>

An analyst incorrectly calculates a project's NPV by discounting nominal cash flows using a real discount rate. This error will *most likely* cause the calculated NPV to be:

- A) understated.
- B) overstated.
- C) either overstated or understated, depending on the inflation rate.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

* **B is correct.** A nominal rate includes a premium for expected inflation, while a real rate does not. Therefore, a real discount rate is lower than a nominal discount rate (assuming positive inflation). By discounting the nominal (higher, inflation-included) cash flows with a real (lower) discount rate, the analyst is not discounting them enough. This will result in a higher, or overstated, calculated NPV.
* **A is incorrect.** Understating the NPV would occur if real cash flows were discounted by a nominal rate.
* **C is incorrect.** The direction of the bias is clear; using a discount rate that is too low will always overstate the present value of future cash inflows.

</details>

When comparing two mutually exclusive projects with unequal lives, the *most* appropriate method for determining which project to select is to:

- A) choose the project with the higher IRR.
- B) choose the project with the higher standalone NPV.
- C) choose the project with the lower equivalent annual annuity (EAA).

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

* **C is correct.** When comparing mutually exclusive projects with different lives, a simple comparison of their NPVs can be misleading. The equivalent annual annuity (EAA) method converts the NPV of each project into an annual payment, allowing for a standardized comparison. The project with the higher EAA (if inflows) or lower EAA (if costs) should be chosen. Both the Least Common Multiple of Lives (replacement chain) and EAA approaches are valid, but EAA is often more practical.
* **A is incorrect.** IRR is not suitable for this comparison, especially given the potential for NPV vs. IRR conflicts.
* **B is incorrect.** Comparing standalone NPVs is inappropriate because the shorter-lived project has the advantage of being replaceable with another value-creating project sooner.

- **question_type**: mcq
- **difficulty**: hard
- **tags**: [IRR, NPV, Unconventional Cash Flow]
</details>

An analyst is evaluating a project with the following cash flow stream: an initial inflow at t=0, followed by five years of outflows, and a final inflow at the end. This project *most likely* has:

- A) a negative NPV regardless of the discount rate.
- B) a negative IRR.
- C) multiple IRRs.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

* **C is correct.** The internal rate of return (IRR) is the discount rate that sets the NPV to zero. For a project with unconventional cash flows (more than one change in the sign of the cash flows), it is possible to have multiple discount rates that result in a zero NPV. This project has two sign changes (from + to -, and then from - to +), making multiple IRRs a likely outcome.
* **A is incorrect.** It is possible for the project to have a positive NPV within a certain range of discount rates.
* **B is incorrect.** A negative IRR is a possible outcome, but the key issue with this cash flow pattern is the potential for multiple IRRs, which makes the IRR an unreliable decision metric.
