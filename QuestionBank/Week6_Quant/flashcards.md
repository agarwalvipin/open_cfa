How is the intercept term (\(\hat{b}_0\)) in a simple linear regression equation \(\hat{Y}_i = \hat{b}_0 + \hat{b}_1 X_i\) interpreted?;It is the predicted value of the dependent variable (\(Y\)) when the independent variable (\(X\)) is equal to zero.[cite: 4583];Week6 Quant RegressionCoefficients

What is the least squares criterion in linear regression?;The regression line is chosen to minimize the sum of the squared differences between the actual Y-values and the Y-values predicted by the regression equation (Sum of Squared Errors - SSE).[cite: 4571, 4573];Week6 Quant RegressionModel
What are the four main assumptions underlying a simple linear regression model regarding the residual term?;1. Linear relationship between X and Y. 2. Variance of residuals is constant (homoskedasticity). 3. Residuals are independently distributed. 4. Residuals are normally distributed.[cite: 4599, 4600, 4601, 4602];Week6 Quant RegressionAssumptions
What does a residual plot showing a fanning-out pattern of residuals as the independent variable increases indicate?;Heteroskedasticity, meaning the variance of the error term is not constant.[cite: 4607, 4608];Week6 Quant RegressionAssumptions
What is the coefficient of determination (\(R^2\)) in a simple linear regression?;It measures the percentage of the total variation in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable. \(R^2 = \text{SSR / SST}\).[cite: 4646];Week6 Quant RegressionFit
What is the Standard Error of Estimate (SEE) in a regression model?;It is the standard deviation of the residuals and measures the typical distance between the actual Y-values and the predicted Y-values. SEE = \(\sqrt{\text{MSE}}\).[cite: 4645];Week6 Quant RegressionFit
In simple linear regression, what does the F-statistic test?;It tests the overall significance of the regression model, which is equivalent to testing whether the slope coefficient (\(b_1\)) is significantly different from zero.[cite: 4651];Week6 Quant RegressionFit
How do you calculate a predicted value (\(\hat{Y}_f\)) for the dependent variable given an estimated linear regression model and a value for the independent variable (\(X_f\))?;\(\hat{Y}_f = \hat{b}_0 + \hat{b}_1 X_f\)<br>Substitute the value of \(X_f\) into the estimated regression equation.[cite: 4676];Week6 Quant RegressionPrediction
How is the slope coefficient interpreted in a log-lin model (\(\ln(Y) = b_0 + b_1 X\))?; \(b_1\) represents the approximate percentage change in Y for a one-unit absolute change in X.[cite: 4695];Week6 Quant RegressionForms
