What is Ethics?;A set of shared beliefs about good/acceptable vs. bad/unacceptable behavior. Also described as conduct following moral principles and consistent with societal expectations.<br>Involves balancing self-interest with impact on stakeholders.;Week1 Ethics Definition
What is a Code of Ethics?;A written set of moral principles guiding behavior by describing acceptable conduct.<br>Communicates values and expectations for a group (e.g., a profession).;Week1 Ethics Code_Definition
What is a Profession?;An occupational group with specialized knowledge/skills, focusing on service to others and agreeing to adhere to a code of ethics.<br>Examples: doctors, lawyers, investment professionals.;Week1 Ethics Profession_Definition
How do Professions establish Trust?;Requiring high expertise standards; setting ethical behavior standards; monitoring conduct; encouraging continuing education; focusing on client needs; mentoring/inspiring others.<br>Trust is crucial when specialized knowledge is involved.;Week1 Ethics Trust
Why are high ethical standards critical in Investment Management?;Entrusted with client wealth; advice is intangible (quality hard to judge); builds client trust; facilitates efficient capital markets; prevents misallocation of capital.<br>Unethical behavior damages client wealth, firm reputation, and market integrity.;Week1 Ethics Importance
What is the difference between Suitability and Fiduciary Standards?;Suitability: Match investment characteristics to client risk/return profile. Fiduciary: Act in the client's best interest (stronger standard).<br>Some regulations require one, others require the other. CFA standards impose a fiduciary duty.;Week1 Ethics Suitability_Fiduciary
What are primary challenges to ethical behavior?;Overrating own ethical quality; focusing on situational influences (e.g., loyalty, money, prestige) over internal traits; overly strict rules-based compliance focus (checking boxes vs. doing right).<br>External pressures often override personal traits.;Week1 Ethics Challenges
How do Ethical and Legal standards compare?;Not all unethical acts are illegal, and vice versa (e.g., civil disobedience). Ethics often sets a higher standard than law. New laws often follow perceived ethical lapses.<br>Ethical decisions require more judgment than legal compliance.;Week1 Ethics Legal_vs_Ethical
What is the purpose of an Ethical Decision-Making Framework?;To help individuals identify issues, consider perspectives, develop judgment, and avoid unintended ethical consequences.<br>Integrates ethics into the decision process.;Week1 Ethics Framework_Purpose
What are the steps in CFA Institute's recommended Ethical Decision-Making Framework?;1. Identify (facts, stakeholders, duties, principles, conflicts). 2. Consider (situational influences, guidance, alternatives). 3. Decide and Act. 4. Reflect (evaluate outcomes).<br>A systematic approach to ethical choices.;Week1 Ethics Framework_Steps

How can interest rates be interpreted?;As required rates of return (compensation for lending), discount rates (to find PV), or opportunity costs (of current consumption vs. saving).<br>Reflects the time value of money.;Week1 Quant Interest_Rate_Interpretation
What is the Real Risk-Free Rate of Interest?;The theoretical rate on a single-period loan with no expectation of inflation and no default risk.<br>Represents time preference for consumption.;Week1 Quant Rate_Real_Risk_Free
What is the relationship between Nominal Risk-Free Rate, Real Risk-Free Rate, and Inflation?;Approximate: Nominal Rate \(\approx\) Real Rate + Inflation Premium. Exact: \((1 + \text{Nominal Rate}) = (1 + \text{Real Rate})(1 + \text{Expected Inflation Rate})\).<br>Nominal rates include compensation for expected inflation.;Week1 Quant Rate_Nominal_vs_Real Formula
What risk premiums can be added to the Nominal Risk-Free Rate?;Default Risk Premium, Liquidity Premium, Maturity Risk Premium.<br>Required Rate \(\approx\) Nominal RFR + DRP + LP + MRP.;Week1 Quant Rate_Premiums
What is the Holding Period Return (HPR)?;The total return on an investment over the period it was held.<br>Formula: \(HPR = \frac{P_1 - P_0 + D_1}{P_0}\), where P0=Beg Price, P1=End Price, D1=Income.;Week1 Quant HPR Definition Formula
How is the total HPR calculated over multiple periods?;By compounding the individual period HPRs.<br>Formula: \((1+HPR_{\text{Total}}) = (1+HPR_1) \times \dots \times (1+HPR_n)\), then subtract 1.;Week1 Quant HPR Multiperiod
What is the Arithmetic Mean Return?;The simple average of a series of periodic returns.<br>Formula: \(\bar{R} = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^T R_t}{T}\). Best estimate of next period's return.;Week1 Quant Mean_Arithmetic Formula
What is the Geometric Mean Return?;A compound rate; measures the average rate of return assuming reinvestment.<br>Formula: \(R_G = \left[ \prod_{t=1}^T (1+R_t) \right]^{1/T} - 1\). Best measure of past performance.;Week1 Quant Mean_Geometric Formula
Which mean return measure is typically lower?;Geometric mean is always less than or equal to the arithmetic mean. The difference increases with return volatility.<br>They are equal only if all returns are identical.;Week1 Quant Mean_Comparison
What is the Harmonic Mean used for?;Calculating the average cost of shares purchased over time with a fixed amount invested periodically (dollar-cost averaging).<br>Formula: \(\bar{X}_H = \frac{N}{\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{X_i}}\). Always â‰¤ Geometric Mean.;Week1 Quant Mean_Harmonic Formula
How do you annualize an HPR for a period shorter or longer than a year?;Use the formula \(R_{\text{Annual}} = (1 + HPR)^{\frac{365}{\text{Days}}} - 1\).<br>'Days' is the number of days in the holding period.;Week1 Quant Annualized_Return Formula
What is a Continuously Compounded Return?;The return assuming instantaneous compounding.<br>Formula: \(R_{CC} = \ln(1+HPR) = \ln(\frac{\text{Ending Value}}{\text{Beginning Value}})\). Additive across periods.;Week1 Quant Continuous_Compounding Formula
What is Gross Return?;Total return on a portfolio before deducting management and administrative fees.<br>Includes impact of trading costs (commissions).;Week1 Quant Return_Gross
What is Net Return?;Return after deducting management and administrative fees from gross return.<br>Represents return actually received by the investor from the manager.;Week1 Quant Return_Net
What is Pretax Nominal Return?;Return before accounting for taxes on income or capital gains.<br>Does not consider tax impact.;Week1 Quant Return_Pretax
What is After-Tax Nominal Return?;Return after deducting tax liabilities.<br>Reflects return available after taxes paid.;Week1 Quant Return_After_Tax
What is Real Return?;Return adjusted for inflation; measures the increase in purchasing power.<br>Approximate: Real \(\approx\) Nominal - Inflation. Exact: \(1 + \text{Real} = \frac{1 + \text{Nominal}}{1 + \text{Inflation}}\).;Week1 Quant Return_Real Formula
What is Leveraged Return?;Return on an investment that is magnified using borrowed funds.<br>Calculated as return on the investor's cash equity portion.;Week1 Quant Return_Leveraged
What is the formula for Leveraged Return Rate ($R_L$)?; \(R_L = \frac{r(V_0 + V_B) - r_B V_B}{V_0}\)<br>Where r=return on assets, V0=equity, VB=borrowed amount, rB=borrowing rate.;Week1 Quant Return_Leveraged Formula
