## 📘 Central Tendency & Dispersion (Reading 3)

---

### 1. Arithmetic Mean (Simple Average)

```
Mean = (X₁ + X₂ + ... + Xn) / n
```

---

### 2. Median

- The middle value when data is arranged in order.
- If even number of values: average of two middle numbers.

---

### 3. Mode

- Most frequently occurring value(s) in a dataset.
- **Unimodal**, **bimodal**, or **multimodal** possible.

---

### 4. Weighted Mean

```
Weighted Mean = Σ (Wi × Xi)
```
- Wi = weight of observation i  
- Xi = value of observation i

---

### 5. Geometric Mean

```
Geometric Mean = [(1 + R₁)(1 + R₂)...(1 + Rn)]^(1/n) – 1
```
- Used for compound returns over time.

---

### 6. Harmonic Mean

```
Harmonic Mean = n / Σ (1 / Xi)
```
- Used when averaging ratios (like P/E or speed).

---

### 7. Range

```
Range = Max – Min
```

---

### 8. Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)

```
MAD = Σ |Xi – Mean| / n
```

---

### 9. Variance

- **Population Variance**:
```
σ² = Σ (Xi – μ)² / N
```

- **Sample Variance**:
```
s² = Σ (Xi – X̄)² / (n – 1)
```

---

### 10. Standard Deviation

```
σ or s = √Variance
```

---

### 11. Coefficient of Variation (CV)

```
CV = Standard Deviation / Mean
```
- A measure of relative risk per unit of return.

---

### 12. Sharpe Ratio (Risk-Adjusted Return)

```
Sharpe Ratio = (Portfolio Return – Risk-Free Rate) / Standard Deviation
```

---

### 13. Skewness

- Positive skew: tail on right, mean > median > mode  
- Negative skew: tail on left, mean < median < mode

---

### 14. Kurtosis

- Mesokurtic (normal): kurtosis = 3  
- Leptokurtic (fat tails): kurtosis > 3  
- Platykurtic (thin tails): kurtosis < 3

---

## 📘 Probability & Bayes’ Formula (Reading 4)

---

### 1. Probability Rules

**Addition Rule (Not mutually exclusive):**
```
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A and B)
```

**Multiplication Rule (Independent Events):**
```
P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B)
```

**Multiplication Rule (Conditional Events):**
```
P(A and B) = P(A | B) × P(B)
```

**Complement Rule:**
```
P(not A) = 1 – P(A)
```

---

### 2. Conditional Probability

```
P(A | B) = P(A and B) / P(B)
```

---

### 3. Joint Probability

```
P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B | A)
```
- For dependent events.

---

### 4. Total Probability Rule

If events A and B are exhaustive and mutually exclusive:
```
P(E) = P(A) × P(E | A) + P(B) × P(E | B)
```

---

### 5. Bayes’ Theorem

```
P(A | B) = [P(B | A) × P(A)] / P(B)
```

Where:
- P(A | B) = Posterior probability  
- P(B | A) = Likelihood  
- P(A) = Prior probability  
- P(B) = Marginal probability

---

### 6. Expected Value

```
E(X) = Σ [P(xi) × xi]
```

---

### 7. Variance of a Discrete Random Variable

```
Var(X) = Σ [P(xi) × (xi – E(X))²]
```

---

### 8. Covariance and Correlation

(Not yet covered in Week 3 but appears later — just a note for future reference.)

---

# 🧠 Notes:
- Use **geometric mean** for multi-period returns.
- Use **Bayes' Formula** to update probabilities after new info.
- **Standard deviation** and **CV** are key risk measures in finance.
