What are the main measures of central tendency?;Arithmetic mean, median, and mode.<br>They identify the center or typical value of a dataset.;Week3 Quant Central_Tendency
What is the Arithmetic Mean?;The sum of the observation values divided by the number of observations.<br>Formula: \(\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n}\);Week3 Quant Mean Arithmetic
What is the Median?;The midpoint of a dataset arranged in ascending or descending order. Half the observations are above, half below.<br>Less affected by outliers than the mean.;Week3 Quant Median
How is the Median calculated for an even number of observations?;It's the arithmetic mean of the two middle observations after arranging the data.<br>E.g., for {1, 2, 3, 4}, the median is (2+3)/2 = 2.5.;Week3 Quant Median Calculation
What is the Mode?;The value that occurs most frequently in a dataset.<br>A dataset can be unimodal, bimodal, trimodal, or have no mode.;Week3 Quant Mode
What is a Trimmed Mean?;A mean calculated after excluding a specified percentage of the lowest and highest observations.<br>Reduces the influence of outliers.;Week3 Quant Mean Trimmed
What is a Winsorized Mean?;A mean calculated after substituting a specified value for the lowest and highest observations (e.g., substituting the 5th percentile value for all values below it).<br>Reduces outlier influence without discarding data.;Week3 Quant Mean Winsorized
What is a Quantile?;The general term for a value at or below which a stated proportion of the data lies.<br>Includes quartiles (quarters), quintiles (fifths), deciles (tenths), and percentiles (hundredths).;Week3 Quant Quantile
What is Dispersion?;The variability of data points around the central tendency.<br>Common measures include range, MAD, variance, and standard deviation.;Week3 Quant Dispersion
What is the Range?;The difference between the maximum and minimum value in a dataset.<br>Formula: Range = Max Value - Min Value;Week3 Quant Dispersion Range
What is the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)?;The average of the absolute values of the deviations from the arithmetic mean.<br>Formula: \(MAD = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - \bar{x}|}{n}\);Week3 Quant Dispersion MAD
What is Sample Variance (\(s^2\))? ;A measure of dispersion calculated as the sum of squared deviations from the sample mean, divided by (n-1).<br>Formula: \(s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}\);Week3 Quant Dispersion Variance
Why use (n-1) in the denominator for sample variance?;Using (n-1) makes the sample variance an unbiased estimator of the population variance. Using n would systematically underestimate it.;Week3 Quant Variance Unbiased
What is Sample Standard Deviation (s)?;The positive square root of the sample variance. It has the same units as the original data.<br>Formula: \(s = \sqrt{s^2}\);Week3 Quant Dispersion Stdev
What is the Coefficient of Variation (CV)?;A measure of relative dispersion, calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean.<br>Formula: \(CV = \frac{s}{\bar{x}}\). Used to compare variability of datasets with different means or units.;Week3 Quant Dispersion CV
What is Target Downside Deviation (Target Semideviation)?;A measure of downside risk, calculating variability using only observations that fall below a specified target return (\(R_T\)).<br>Formula: \(s_{target} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{R_i < R_T} (R_i - R_T)^2}{n-1}}\);Week3 Quant Dispersion Downside
What is Skewness?;A measure of the asymmetry of a probability distribution around its mean.<br>Zero skew means symmetric. Positive skew means a long right tail. Negative skew means a long left tail.;Week3 Quant Skewness Definition
How does skewness affect Mean, Median, and Mode?;Symmetric: Mean = Median = Mode. Positively skewed: Mode < Median < Mean. Negatively skewed: Mean < Median < Mode.<br>The mean is pulled in the direction of the skew.;Week3 Quant Skewness Measures
What is Kurtosis?;A measure of the peakedness of a distribution and the "fatness" of its tails compared to a normal distribution.<br>Indicates the probability of extreme outcomes.;Week3 Quant Kurtosis Definition
What are Leptokurtic, Platykurtic, and Mesokurtic distributions?;Leptokurtic: More peaked, fatter tails (Kurtosis > 3). Platykurtic: Less peaked, thinner tails (Kurtosis < 3). Mesokurtic: Same kurtosis as normal distribution (Kurtosis = 3).<br>Finance often uses Excess Kurtosis (Kurtosis - 3).;Week3 Quant Kurtosis Types
Why are skewness and kurtosis important in risk management?;Financial returns often exhibit skewness (usually negative) and excess kurtosis (leptokurtic), meaning extreme negative outcomes are more likely than a normal distribution implies.<br>Assuming normality underestimates risk.;Week3 Quant Risk_Management
What is Correlation?;A standardized measure of the linear relationship between two variables, ranging from -1 to +1.<br>Formula: \(\rho_{XY} = \frac{Cov(X,Y)}{s_X s_Y}\);Week3 Quant Correlation Definition
What does a correlation coefficient of +1, -1, or 0 indicate?;+1: Perfect positive linear relationship. -1: Perfect negative linear relationship. 0: No linear relationship.<br>Correlation does not imply causation.;Week3 Quant Correlation Interpretation
What is Spurious Correlation?;Correlation that appears due to chance or because both variables are related to a third, unmeasured variable.<br>Does not indicate a true causal relationship.;Week3 Quant Correlation Spurious
What is the Expected Value of a random variable?;The probability-weighted average of its possible outcomes.<br>Formula: \(E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^n P(x_i) x_i\);Week3 Quant Expected_Value Definition
How is the Variance calculated from a probability model?;It's the probability-weighted sum of the squared deviations from the expected value.<br>Formula: \(\sigma^2(X) = E[(X - E(X))^2] = \sum_{i=1}^n P(x_i) [x_i - E(X)]^2\);Week3 Quant Variance Probability_Model
What is a Probability Tree used for?;To show probabilities of sequential events and calculate joint probabilities of outcomes.<br>Helps visualize conditional probabilities.;Week3 Quant Probability_Tree
What are Conditional Expected Values?;Expected values calculated based on the occurrence of some other event or conditional information.<br>Used to update expectations when new info arrives.;Week3 Quant Expected_Value Conditional
What is Bayes' Formula used for?;To update a prior probability of an event based on new information (the occurrence of another event).<br>Formula: \(P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)}{P(B)} P(A)\);Week3 Quant Bayes_Formula
