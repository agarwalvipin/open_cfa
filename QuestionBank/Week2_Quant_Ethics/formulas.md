## ðŸ“˜ Quantitative Methods â€“ Time Value of Money (TVM)

---

### 1. Future Value (FV) of a Single Sum

$$FV = PV \times (1 + r)^n$$

---

### 2. Present Value (PV) of a Single Sum

$$PV = \frac{FV}{(1 + r)^n}$$

---

### 3. Future Value (FV) of an Ordinary Annuity

$$FV_{\text{annuity}} = PMT \times \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r}$$

---

### 4. Present Value (PV) of an Ordinary Annuity

$$PV_{\text{annuity}} = PMT \times \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r}$$

---

### 5. Future Value (FV) of an Annuity Due

$$FV_{\text{annuity\_due}} = FV_{\text{annuity}} \times (1 + r)$$

---

### 6. Present Value (PV) of an Annuity Due

$$PV_{\text{annuity\_due}} = PV_{\text{annuity}} \times (1 + r)$$

---

### 7. Present Value (PV) of a Perpetuity

$$PV_{\text{perpetuity}} = \frac{PMT}{r}$$

---

### 8. Effective Annual Rate (EAR)

$$EAR = \left(1 + \frac{r_{\text{nominal}}}{n}\right)^n - 1$$

Where:
- r_nominal = stated annual interest rate
- n = number of compounding periods per year

---

### 9. Present Value of Deferred Annuity

$$PV_{\text{today}} = \frac{PV_{\text{deferred}}}{(1 + r)^k}$$

Where:
- k = number of periods before first payment

---

### 10. Rule of 72 (Approximation)

$$\text{Doubling Time} \approx \frac{72}{\text{interest rate (\%)}}$$

---
