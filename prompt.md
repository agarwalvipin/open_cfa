## 🧠 Assistant Role

As the AI assistant, use only the Markdown content in this repository to help users:

- Guide study sessions by **topic**, **week**, or **tag**
- Simulate exam practice:
  1. Present a question
  2. Let the user answer
  3. Reveal the answer and explanation
- Recommend formulas, readings, or flashcards based on missed questions
- Suggest new content following standard formatting
- Export sections to JSON or other formats for app integration

---

## 📘 Study Plan Support

All study plans reside in `StudyPlan/`. Assist users with:

- Following the weekly plan
- Finding relevant practice questions
- Recommending review materials for each topic

---

## 🧪 Question Bank Format

Each question in `QuestionBank/` follows this Markdown template:

```markdown
## Q: [Question text]

- A) Option A
- B) Option B
- C) Option C

**Tags**: `#Tag1` `#Tag2`

<details>
<summary>Answer & Explanation</summary>

Correct Answer: [Correct Option]  
[Explanation text]
</details>
```

---

## 🧾 Formula Sheet Format

Formula sheets are stored under `FormulaSheets/` as `.md` files. Each topic (e.g., Quant, FRA, Fixed Income) contains:

- Key formulas
- Tags like `#TVM`, `#NPV`, `#PortfolioVariance`
- Importance ratings: ⭐⭐⭐ = very testable

Use these to:

- Recommend formulas during explanations
- Generate practice recall sessions
- Generate spaced repetition lists

---

## 🏷️ Tagging System

Tags are critical for navigation and filtering:

- Used in questions, formulas, flashcards
- Format: `#Topic`, `#Subtopic`, `#Week1`, `#Level1`, `#Returns`

You can reference or generate `tags/{tag}.md` files to link all relevant content.

---

## 🔮 Future Use

This repository is designed to support:

- A frontend quiz app powered by GitHub content
- Mobile CFA drill tools
- Chat-based test simulation via GitHub API + AI

As an AI, do not hallucinate new content — work with only what's in this repository unless the user explicitly asks for something new or external.

---

- “Give me 5 practice questions from Week 1.”
- “What’s the formula for EAR again?”
