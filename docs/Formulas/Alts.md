- 💰 **GP Performance Fee with Hard Hurdle:**

  $$r_{GP} = \max[0, p(r - r_h)]$$

  where:
  - $r_{GP}$ = GP's rate of return from the performance fee
  - $p$ = Performance fee percentage (e.g., 20%)
  - $r$ = The fund's gross return for the period
  - $r_h$ = The hard hurdle rate

- 🔄 **Internal Rate of Return (IRR):**

  $$\sum_{t=0}^{n}\frac{CF_{t}}{(1+IRR)^{t}} = 0$$

  where:
  - $CF_t$ = Cash flow at time t
  - $IRR$ = Internal Rate of Return
  - $n$ = Number of periods

- 📈 **Multiple of Invested Capital (MOIC):**

  $$\text{MOIC} = \frac{\text{Realized Value of Investment} + \text{Unrealized Value of Investment}}{\text{Total Amount of Invested Capital}}$$

- ⚖️ **Leveraged Return:**

  $$r_L = r + \frac{V_b}{V_c}(r - r_b)$$

  where:
  - $r_L$ = Leveraged rate of return
  - $r$ = Return on the unleveraged assets
  - $V_b$ = Amount of borrowed funds
  - $V_c$ = Amount of cash (equity) capital invested
  - $r_b$ = Borrowing rate

- 💼 **Fund Fees and Investor Return Calculations:**

  - 💰 **GP Fees in Currency Terms:**
    $$R_{GP} = (\text{End Value} \times r_m) + \max[0, (\text{Profit}) \times p]$$

  - 📊 **Investor Rate of Return:**
    $$r_i = \frac{\text{End Value} - \text{Start Value} - R_{GP}}{\text{Start Value}}$$

  where:
  - $r_m$ = Management fee rate
  - $p$ = Performance fee rate

  - $S_0$ = Spot price today
  - $e$ = Base of the natural logarithm (~2.718)
  - $r$ = Risk-free rate
  - $c$ = Storage costs
  - $y$ = Convenience yield (the non-monetary benefit of holding the physical asset)
