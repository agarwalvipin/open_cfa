*(Corporate Issuers Topic – 5–10 % of the Level I exam)*

---

## LOS 22.a Describe the principal–agent relationship and the conflicts that may arise between stakeholder groups

| **Key idea**                             | **What it means**                                                                  | **Relatable Indian example**                                                                                                                                 | **Exam hot-spot 🔑**                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Principal–agent relationship**         | Shareholders (principals) delegate control of resources to managers (agents).      | When Infosys’ founders ceded operational control to a professional CEO, the board had to monitor that the CEO’s incentives stayed aligned with shareholders. | Identify which party is **principal** vs **agent** in a vignette.         |
| **Manager vs shareholder conflict**      | Managers may prefer empire-building, perks, or lower risk than owners want.        | PSU-bank executives historically lent to politically connected borrowers, not always value-maximising.                                                       | Look for “free-cash-flow problem.”                                        |
| **Controlling vs minority shareholders** | Majority owners can tunnel value away via related-party deals or dividend policy.  | Family-controlled listed companies (e.g., some promoter-led firms on the BSE) buying raw materials from promoter-owned private entities at inflated prices.  | Know that this conflict is **common in emerging markets**.                |
| **Shareholders vs creditors**            | Equity holders may take on extra leverage or risky projects that hurt debtholders. | Yes Bank’s aggressive loan growth (2016-18) pleased equity holders but alarmed bond holders.                                                                 | CFA questions often ask who bears extra risk after leverage changes.      |
| **Shareholders vs other stakeholders**   | Issues of employee safety, community, environment.                                 | Vedanta’s mining operations faced protests over environmental concerns.                                                                                      | Link to ESG trends – the exam tests vocabulary (double-materiality etc.). |

> **Tip for Level I:** Sketch a quick “conflict map” on scratch paper during the exam – it helps you see which group is harmed or benefits in scenario questions.
> **Memory hook:** **M-S-C-C** → *Manager, Shareholder, Creditor, Community*.

## LOS 22.b Describe corporate governance and mechanisms to manage stakeholder relationships & mitigate risks

### 1. What **Corporate Governance (CG)** is

A system of **internal controls, processes and practices** by which **stakeholder interests are safeguarded and conflicts are resolved** .

### 2. **Internal mechanisms**

| Mechanism                                                                | How it works                                                                          | Indian touchpoint                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Board of directors (BoD)** – independence, expertise, regular meetings | Represents shareholders, sets strategy, hires/fires CEO, oversees risk.               | SEBI-LODR mandates ≥ 1/3 independent directors; top 1000 firms need a woman independent director. |
| **Board committees** – audit, remuneration, nomination, risk             | Provide focused oversight.                                                            | Companies Act 2013 requires an audit committee with a majority of independent directors.          |
| **Compensation design**                                                  | Performance-linked pay, restricted stock, claw-backs align manager & owner interests. | Infosys adopted a claw-back policy after founder concerns on executive pay (2017).                |
| **Shareholder meetings & voting**                                        | Cumulative voting, proxy access, say-on-pay.                                          | Institutional investors like LIC or SBI MF often influence ESG resolutions.                       |
| **Internal controls & code of conduct**                                  | Segregation of duties, whistle-blower policy.                                         | The *Satyam* episode accelerated whistle-blower mechanisms across IT firms.                       |

### 3. **External mechanisms**

| Mechanism                                               | Why it matters                                          | Example                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Legal & regulatory** framework                        | Companies Act 2013, Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, SEBI. | SEBI’s 2021 regulation on related-party transactions.                                          |
| **Statutory audit & IFRS / Ind-AS reporting**           | Independent assurance reduces information asymmetry.    | Big-4 resignations often spark stock sell-offs.                                                |
| **Market for corporate control (M\&A, activist funds)** | Poorly governed firms become takeover targets.          | Larsen & Toubro’s hostile bid for Mindtree highlighted dispersed shareholding vulnerabilities. |
| **Media & analyst scrutiny**                            | Reputation cost disciplines management.                 | Investigative journalism uncovered IL\&FS governance failures.                                 |

> **Exam tips 📝**
>
> * Know **which mechanism addresses which conflict**.
> * Remember “**independent, skilled, long-term–oriented**” as descriptors of an effective BoD.
> * Questions often ask “*most effective*” vs “*least costly*” mechanism.

## LOS 22.c Describe potential risks of poor CG & benefits of effective CG

| **Risks when CG is weak**                     | **Indian illustration**                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Accounting fraud → legal penalties, delisting | *Satyam Computer Services* (2009) – \$1.5 bn hole in books, wiped out investors, founder jailed.         |
| Excess leverage & default                     | **IL\&FS** (2018) – board failed to check risky borrowing; liquidity crisis spilled over to NBFC sector. |
| Asset misappropriation by insiders            | Some micro-cap “pump-and-dump” schemes on SME exchanges.                                                 |
| Reputational damage, higher cost of capital   | Lenders demanded premium yields from **Café Coffee Day** after governance concerns.                      |

| **Benefits when CG is strong**  | **Indian illustration**                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lower cost of equity & debt     | **HDFC Bank** trades at premium valuations and issues bonds at fine spreads due to trust in governance.         |
| Better operational performance  | **Asian Paints** – professional management plus promoter oversight → industry-leading ROE.                      |
| Easier access to global capital | Strong CG helped **Tata Consultancy Services** list on NYSE and attract US investors.                           |
| Resilience in crises            | **Infosys** weathered leadership tussles in 2017 with minimal market impact due to transparent board processes. |

## 📋  Formulas in Reading 22

Reading 22 is largely conceptual. The only “formula-like” expression sometimes shown is:

> **Net Agency Cost**
> \= Monitoring Costs **+** Bonding Costs **+** Residual Loss

Remember the components but you will **not** need to compute numbers.

## 🏃‍♂️  Quick Exam-Day Pointer

1. **Read the vignette title** – it tells you whether you are the analyst, board member, or regulator; that sets the perspective.
2. **Underline stakeholder groups** in the stem: manager, controlling shareholder, minority, creditor, customer. Map conflict quickly.
3. **Watch qualifiers** – “*least likely*” vs “*most effective*”.
4. For fact-pattern items, **answer from CFA principles, not local law** (even though we used Indian examples here).
5. No calculator is required for this reading – **bank time** for heavy-math sections elsewhere.

Good governance ≈ better marks – happy studying, Vipin!
