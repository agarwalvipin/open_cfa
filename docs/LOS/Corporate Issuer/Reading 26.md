## üîπ LOS 26.a  Describe **key features** of business models

The text organises a model around five constant questions‚Äî**Who, What, How, Where, How much** . Below is a one-to-one mapping.

| Core question                               | What the book says                                                               | Indian-context example                                                                        | üéØ Exam-focus pointers                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Who?‚ÄîCustomers & segmentation**           | Identify potential customers, cost of acquisition, retention metrics             | **Nykaa** segments beauty shoppers by age & spending band, tailoring separate app home-pages. | ‚Ä¢ Be able to spot *segmenting* vs *targeting*. <br>‚Ä¢ MCQs may ask which metric (e.g., CAC) belongs here. |
| **What?‚ÄîProduct/service & differentiation** | Explain need-fulfilment and competitive edge (price, quality, innovation)        | **Amul** differentiates on ‚Äúvalue-for-money dairy‚Äù plus wide SKU variety.                     | Expect a question that hides *price leadership* in an answer choice about the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù.                    |
| **How?‚ÄîKey assets & suppliers**             | Patents, tech stack, skilled staff, critical vendors                             | **Ola Electric‚Äôs** battery IP and tie-ups with Korean cell makers.                            | Link to *sustainable competitive advantage* & ROIC.                                                      |
| **Where?‚ÄîChannel strategy**                 | Direct vs intermediaries, online vs offline, omnichannel                         | **Tanishq** combines flagship stores (experience) with an e-commerce site (reach).            | If a vignette mentions *B2B* vs *B2C*, that‚Äôs part of ‚Äúwhere‚Äù.                                           |
| **How much?‚ÄîPricing strategy**              | Commodity pricing, price discrimination (tiered, dynamic, value-based, auction)  | **IRCTC** uses dynamic surge pricing on Tatkal tickets; **Zomato Pro** is value-based.        | Watch for terms like *tiered pricing* or *freemium*‚Äîthey sit here, not under ‚Äúwhat‚Äù.                     |

### Extra features the reading emphasises

* **Value proposition vs. value chain** ‚Äî know the difference: proposition = customer-facing promise; value chain = internal execution steps (Porter‚Äôs five activities) .
* **Network effects** ‚Äî value rises with user base (e.g., **UPI** payments or **Flipkart** marketplace) .
* **Omnichannel** ‚Äî seamless physical + digital (e.g., **Reliance Trends**‚Äô ‚Äúorder online, pick-up in store‚Äù).

## üåü High-yield reminders

1. **Definitions > maths** ‚Äì This reading is conceptual; no formulas here. Drill the vocabulary.
2. **Feature ‚â† Type** ‚Äì In MCQs, distractors blend a *feature* (e.g., network effects) with a *type* (e.g., SaaS). Classify first, answer second.
3. **Cross-reading links** ‚Äì Business-model traits influence ROE (Reading 25), working-capital cycle (Reading 23), and stakeholder conflicts (Reading 22). CFAI loves integration.
4. **Indian regulatory twists** ‚Äì Telecom spectrum auctions, RBI neo-bank rules, or ed-tech guidelines can materially move a model‚Äôs cost curve‚Äîgood vignette fodder.

### üìù Flash-card dump (memorise these buzzwords)

* **Value proposition**
* **Value chain (Porter‚Äôs 5)**
* **Omnichannel**
* **Penetration pricing vs. freemium**
* **Network effects**
* **Private label vs. licensing**

## ‚úÖ How to drill this for November ‚Äô25

* **Write your own two-sentence summary** for each model type with a desi brand‚Äîmemory sticks better.
* **Practice identifying ‚Äúthe five questions‚Äù** in any company news article; you‚Äôll train your eye for exam stems.
* **Spend saved formula-study time** (none here!) on WACC & CCC calculations in Readings 23‚Äì25.
