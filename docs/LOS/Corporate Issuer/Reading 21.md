### Reading 21 – **Investors & Other Stakeholders**

*(Corporate Issuers Topic | Module 21.1 | LOS 21-a, 21-b, 21-c)*&#x20;

---

## 1️⃣ LOS 21-a – *Lenders vs. Shareholders*

| Dimension           | Lenders (Creditors)                                                          | Shareholders (Owners)                                            | Indian Snapshot                                                                           |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Financial claim** | Contractual: principal + interest, senior in liquidation                     | Residual: after all liabilities                                  | SBI term-loan to Adani Ports vs. retail investors holding equity                          |
| **Return profile**  | Fixed, capped; upside limited, downside mitigated by collateral/covenants    | Unlimited upside, full downside to zero                          | Yes Bank AT-1 bond holders (fixed coupon) vs. equity holders riding 2023–24 recovery      |
| **Risk focus**      | Probability of default (PD); loss-given-default (LGD); cash-flow sufficiency | Sustainable growth, reinvestment opportunities, market sentiment | Banks look at **interest-coverage ratio**; equity analysts look at ROE vs. cost of equity |
| **Control levers**  | Covenants, collateral, security trustees                                     | Voting rights, board representation                              | L\&T takeover of Mindtree: activist shareholders mattered, lenders largely indifferent    |

**Exam tip:** If the stem asks *“Which stakeholder is most sensitive to leverage increase?”* the answer is almost always **lenders**, because higher leverage worsens PD/LGD and jeopardises covenant headroom.

## 2️⃣ LOS 21-b – *Stakeholder Groups & Their Interests*

> “A company is a nexus of contracts.”
> — CFA curriculum

| Group                         | Primary Interests                                         | Indian Example                              |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Equity investors**          | Dividends, capital appreciation, effective governance     | HDFC Bank shareholders after mega-merger    |
| **Creditors**                 | Timely interest & principal, maintenance of asset quality | SBI, Axis Bank syndicate loans to JSW Steel |
| **Employees**                 | Job security, wages, welfare, skill growth                | Infosys campus-training, ESOP allocations   |
| **Suppliers**                 | Prompt payment, long-term offtake                         | Maruti-Suzuki tier-1 vendors                |
| **Customers**                 | Quality, price, after-sales support                       | UPI apps’ focus on zero-charge payments     |
| **Government & Regulators**   | Taxes, compliance, systemic stability                     | SEBI, RBI norms on corporate disclosure     |
| **Communities / Environment** | CSR impact, sustainability, employment                    | Tata Steel’s Jamshedpur township model      |

### Balancing interests

Management must **prioritise** cash-flow claims (creditors first) yet **maximise** long-term firm value (equity). Modern boards use *stakeholder mapping* to identify power vs. interest and mitigate conflicts (e.g., salary freeze for top execs during COVID to appease employees & media).

**Exam tip:** When confronted with *“least likely to be considered a primary stakeholder”* remember that broad-based “society at large” is **usually** secondary unless the question explicitly frames environmental impact.

## 3️⃣ LOS 21-c – *ESG Factors Considered by Investors*

| Pillar            | Key Metrics                                                   | Indian Illustration                                             | Why Investors Care                                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Environmental** | Carbon intensity, water usage, renewable mix                  | Reliance’s green-energy capex & net-zero 2035 pledge            | Anticipate carbon taxes; align with PRI mandates       |
| **Social**        | Workforce diversity, safety record, data privacy              | Wipro’s gender-parity programmes; Zomato’s gig-worker insurance | Reputational risk, labour-disruption costs             |
| **Governance**    | Board independence, audit quality, related-party transactions | Tata Sons’ 2016 board overhaul; Infosys whistle-blower cases    | Mis-governance leads to valuation discount, higher CoE |

### Integration approaches

1. **Negative screening** – e.g., PFICs excluding tobacco or coal-heavy NTPC debt.
2. **Best-in-class** – choosing HUL over peers for leadership in plastic waste recycling.
3. **Thematic / Impact** – Green bonds by Indian Railways for electric locomotives.
4. **Active ownership** – Mutual funds voting against promoter remuneration excesses.

**Exam tip:** If asked for *“most likely immediate financial impact of poor governance”*, cite **higher cost of capital** due to risk premiums demanded by both debt and equity holders.

## 📌 High-Yield Highlights (“Must-Remember”)

| Concept                                                                                         | Why It Matters                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Creditors’ hierarchy**: Secured → Senior unsecured → Subordinated → Equity                    | Drives required return ordering on exam MCQs                     |
| **Covenant breach ripple**: Triggers higher coupons, accelerates repayment, restricts dividends | Common distractor—remember equity holders lose flexibility first |
| **ESG’s ‘double-materiality’**: Impact on company *and* of company                              | CFA curriculum favourite phrase                                  |
| **Stakeholder conflicts**: Share-buyback vs. debt-covenant restriction                          | Craft practice examples—exam loves trade-off scenarios           |

## 🧮 Formula Sheet (Reading 21)

Reading 21 is primarily conceptual; no unique quantitative formulas beyond standard return or coverage ratios already memorised elsewhere. **Focus on definitions & relationships**.

---

## ⚡ Quick Exam-Day Pointers

1. **LOS verbs**: 21-a “compare”, 21-b “describe/compare”, 21-c “describe” → expect *concept* not heavy maths.
2. **Keywords**: “Unlimited liability”, “residual claimant”, “limited partner”, “stakeholder mapping”, “ESG integration”.
3. **Time management**: These are usually *short conceptual* questions—aim **≤60 seconds** each to bank time for FRA maths.
4. **Indian context memory hook**: Picture *Tata Group annual report ESG section*—helps lock pillar examples in memory.
5. **Eliminate extremes**: Choices claiming “all stakeholders have identical interests” or “equity always has priority” are **red flags**.
