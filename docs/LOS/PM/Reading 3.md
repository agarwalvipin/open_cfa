# CFA Level 1 Portfolio Management: Learning Module 3
## Portfolio Management: An Overview

---

### 1. Introduction

Portfolio Management is about making decisions on investments, their mix, policy, matching goals, asset allocation, and balancing risk & return. The focus is on the **portfolio as a whole**, considering how investments interact.

---

### 2. Portfolio Perspective: Diversification and Risk Reduction

#### Key Idea:
Think about **all assets together** â€” not just individually. This approach reduces unsystematic risk.

**Indian Example:**  
Suppose Lakshmi from Mumbai invests only in TCS shares. If TCS performs poorly, her wealth suffers. But if she invests in a mix â€” Infosys, HDFC Bank, Sovereign Gold Bonds, and Indian government bonds â€” poor performance in one is likely offset by gains in others.

#### *Exam Tips:*
- Diversification is about risk reduction, not just return enhancement.
- Related MCQ: "Which risk can be nearly eliminated through diversification?" (Unsystematic risk)

### 3. Historical Example: Diversification Avoided Disaster

During 2020, Indian investors who held only airline stocks (like Indigo) suffered due to COVID-19. Those who also held pharma (e.g., Sun Pharma) and IT stocks (like Infosys) saw their portfolios stay afloat or even grow.

### 4. Risk-Return Trade-Off, Downside Protection, & Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)

#### Key Idea:
Thereâ€™s **no free lunch**. Higher expected returns âŸº higher risk.

**Indian Example:**  
Equity mutual funds have delivered ~10-12% annual returns over the long term but are volatile. Debt/Liquid Funds give stable ~5-7% but with lower volatility.

#### Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)
- Proposes that portfolios are optimized for **maximum return for a given risk** (efficient frontier).
- *Practical Tip*: SIPs in diversified mutual funds are based on MPT â€” maximizing reward while minimizing risk via diversification.

### 5. Steps in the Portfolio Management Process

1. **Planning Step:**
   - Understand client needs (e.g., retirement planning for a young urban Indian family vs. NPS for senior citizens).
   - Establish Investment Policy Statement (IPS): objectives and constraints.

2. **Execution Step:**
   - Translate plan into actions: asset allocation (equity, bonds, real estate), security selection (SBI shares, ICICI bonds), and portfolio implementation.

3. **Feedback Step:**
   - Monitor and rebalance as goals, markets, or life situations (like job change or kidsâ€™ education) evolve.

---

### 6. Types of Investors

- **Individual Investors:**  
  E.g., Indian retail investors starting SIPs for children's education, retirement, or property purchase.

- **Institutional Investors:**  
  E.g., LIC, Indian pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds.

#### *Exam Pointer:*
Be able to differentiate between needs, objectives, and constraints for these types.

---

### 7. Asset Management Industry: Active vs. Passive

- **Active Management:**  
  Fund managers try to "beat the market". Example: A HDFC Flexi Cap Fund manager picks stocks hoping to outperform Nifty50.

- **Passive Management:**  
  Tries to "match the index". Example: Motilal Oswal Nifty 50 Index Fund.

- **Recent Indian Trend:**  
  Index funds and ETFs have grown rapidly because of low costs and simplicity.

---

### 8. Investment Vehicles in India: Mutual & Pooled Funds

- **Mutual Funds:**
  - Money market funds (liquid, short-term debt)
  - Bond funds (invest in Indian govt/corporate bonds)
  - Equity funds (invest in stocks: blue-chip, mid-cap)
  - Hybrid funds (mix of stocks and bonds)

- **Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs):**  
  Trade on NSE/BSE like shares; e.g., SBI Nifty ETF.

- **Alternative Investments:**  
  - Hedge funds (less in India), Private equity, REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts like Embassy REIT).

---

### 9. **Key Exam Takeaways**

- *Diversification* reduces risk (unsystematic risk).
- Portfolio perspective is superior to single-asset evaluation.
- Modern Portfolio Theory: Know the **Efficient Frontier** concept.
- Three-step management process: Planning, Execution, Feedback.
- Be able to contrast active vs. passive management and provide Indian examples of each.
