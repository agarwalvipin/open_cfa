## Reading 87: The Behavioral Biases of Individuals 🧠

### 🎯 Introduction

Greetings, Samurai. So far, our training has been rooted in **traditional finance**. This school of thought assumes all investors are perfectly rational warriors: logical, emotionless, and able to process all information perfectly to make optimal decisions.

But you and I know the battlefield is not that clean. We are human. We feel fear, greed, and overconfidence. We get attached to "winner" stocks and ignore warning signs. **Behavioral finance** is the study of this reality. It acknowledges that we have systematic, predictable flaws in our thinking.

Understanding these biases is your secret weapon. By recognizing them in *yourself* and in *others*, you can avoid critical errors, understand why markets get "crazy," and become a wiser, more effective investment professional. Let's sharpen this new blade.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 1: The Two Types of Flaws: Cognitive vs. Emotional (LOS 87.a)</span>

Every bias you'll learn stems from one of two sources. Knowing the source is critical because it tells you how to fight it.

1.  **Cognitive Errors (Flawed Thinking):**

      * **What they are:** These are errors in reasoning, memory, or information processing. Think of them as "blind spots" or "faulty software" in your brain.
      * **How to fix them:** They can be corrected\!  Better education, more information, and a structured decision-making process can overcome them. This is like a samurai practicing a kata until the flawed move is gone.
      * **Practical approach:** We *moderate* the impact of these biases by improving our analysis.

2.  **Emotional Biases (Flawed Feelings):**

      * **What they are:** These biases are driven by impulse, intuition, and emotion (fear, greed, pride, regret). They are not about flawed *thinking*, but about feelings *overriding* thought.
      * **How to fix them:** These are much harder to correct. You can't just "educate" yourself out of feeling fear during a market crash.
      * **Practical approach:** We *adapt* to these biases. This means accepting they exist and building a plan (like your IPS) that accounts for them, creating a structure that *contains* the emotion.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 2: The Arsenal of Biases - Cognitive Errors (LOS 87.b)</span>

Let's break down the "faulty software." Cognitive errors fall into two main groups.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.1 Belief Perseverance Biases (Stubbornness)</span>

These biases make you cling to your old beliefs, even when new evidence screams that you're wrong. They stem from **cognitive dissonance**—the mental stress you feel when new information conflicts with a core belief.

  * **Conservatism Bias:** You under-react to new information and are slow to update your beliefs. You're "anchored" to your prior view.
  * **Confirmation Bias:** This is a big one. You actively seek out information that *confirms* your existing belief and ignore or dismiss anything that *contradicts* it.
      * **Implication:** You only read research that supports your "buy" rating on a stock and call contradictory reports "fake news". This leads to overconfidence.
  * **Representativeness Bias:** You classify new information based on your past experiences, leading to "if it looks like a duck..." errors.
      * **Base-Rate Neglect:** You ignore the *actual* probability of something (the "base rate") and focus on a new, specific story. (e.g., You ignore the high failure rate of startups *in general* because *this* one "feels" like the next Google) .
      * **Sample-Size Neglect:** You draw big conclusions from a tiny amount of data. (e.g., "This new fund manager is a genius\! He beat the market for *two whole quarters*\!") .
  * **Illusion of Control Bias:** You believe you can control or influence random outcomes. (e.g., "I'll trade this stock better because I use a special chart," or "I'll wait to buy my lotto ticket until the 'lucky' cashier is working.")
  * **Hindsight Bias:** After an event happens, you believe it was predictable all along ("I knew it\!"). This makes you overconfident about *future* predictions.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.2 Information-Processing Biases (Faulty Calculation)</span>

These biases cause you to miscalculate or misinterpret information.

  * **Anchoring and Adjustment Bias:** You "anchor" on the first piece of information you get (like a stock's purchase price or an analyst's first estimate) and then fail to *adjust* your thinking enough when new information arrives.
  * **Mental Accounting Bias:** You treat money differently depending on where it came from or what it's for. (e.g., You are careful with your "retirement money" but gamble wildly with your "bonus money," even though all money is fungible) .
  * **Framing Bias:** Your decision is changed by the *way* information is presented (or "framed"), even if the underlying facts are identical.
      * **Classic Example:**
          * **Frame 1 (Gain):** "Program A will save 200 people". (You choose this certain gain).
          * **Frame 2 (Loss):** "Program A will cause 400 people to die". (You avoid this certain loss and choose a risky alternative).
          * The outcome is identical (200 saved, 400 die), but framing it as a gain makes you risk-averse, while framing it as a loss makes you risk-seeking.
  * **Availability Bias:** You overestimate the probability of things that are recent, vivid, or easy to recall. (e.g., After a plane crash is on the news, you think flying is more dangerous than driving. Or you buy a stock just because it was advertised during the Super Bowl) .

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 3: The Arsenal of Biases - Emotional Biases (LOS 87.b)</span>

Now we enter the realm of feelings. These are much harder to control.

  * **Loss-Aversion Bias:** This is the *cornerstone* of behavioral finance. The pain of a loss is far more powerful than the pleasure of an equal gain.
      * **Implication:** You're given $10. You'll *take* a certain $5 gain (Option 1) over a 50/50 shot at $10 or $0 (Option 2) because you're risk-averse with gains.
      * BUT, if you're given $20 and *then* faced with a certain $5 loss (Option 1) or a 50/50 shot at losing $10 or $0 (Option 2), you'll *take the gamble*\!  Why? You become risk-seeking to avoid a certain loss.
      * **Result:** You hold on to *losing* stocks, praying they'll come back (to avoid the certain loss), but sell your *winners* too early (to lock in the certain gain).
  * **Overconfidence Bias:** You have an unwarranted faith in your own judgment and abilities.
      * **Prediction Overconfidence:** You underestimate the uncertainty of your predictions.
      * **Certainty Overconfidence:** You overstate the probability that you are right.
      * This is often fueled by **Self-Attribution Bias:** You take credit for your successes ("I'm a genius") but blame external factors for your failures ("The market was irrational").
      * **Implication:** You trade too much and don't diversify enough.
  * **Self-Control Bias:** You lack self-discipline and favor short-term satisfaction over your long-term goals. (e.g., You spend today instead of saving for retirement). This is also called **hyperbolic discounting**—you value a small payoff *now* more than a much larger payoff *later*.
  * **Status Quo Bias:** You prefer to keep things the same, even when a change would be better. (e.g., You never rebalance your portfolio because it's "too much work," so your asset allocation drifts for 20 years) .
  * **Endowment Bias:** You value something *more* just because you *own* it. (e.g., "This stock my grandfather left me is priceless," even though it's a terrible company. You wouldn't pay $5 for it, but you refuse to sell it for $50) .
  * **Regret-Aversion Bias:** You do nothing out of fear that any decision you make will be wrong.
      * You fear **Errors of Commission** (doing something that turns out wrong) more than **Errors of Omission** (not doing something that would have turned out right).
      * **Implication:** You become too conservative. Or, you engage in **Herding Behavior**—you just follow the crowd. Why? Because if you're wrong *with everyone else*, it doesn't feel as bad ("We're not to blame if others are wrong too").

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 4: Biases in Action - Market Bubbles & Anomalies (LOS 87.c)</span>

Behavioral finance can help explain market behavior that traditional finance calls "anomalies".

  * **Market Bubbles and Crashes:** A bubble isn't just one bias; it's a *chain reaction* of them.
    1.  **Overconfidence** (fueled by **self-attribution** and **hindsight bias**) makes investors believe they're geniuses in a bull market.
    2.  **Confirmation bias** makes them ignore any negative news.
    3.  **Anchoring** makes them think recent highs are "rational" prices.
    4.  **Regret-aversion** (herding) keeps skeptical investors in the market, afraid of the regret of missing out on more gains.
  * **Value vs. Growth:** For a long time, value stocks (low P/E, low P/B) have outperformed growth stocks. Traditional finance (Fama & French) argues this is just compensation for extra *risk* (e.g., value firms are riskier). Behavioral finance might argue it's due to biases like representativeness (investors get "wowed" by growth stories and overpay).

### 🎯 Quick Exam-Day Pointers

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

  * **Cognitive vs. Emotional:** This is a critical distinction. Cognitive = Flawed *Thinking* (Correct with education). Emotional = Flawed *Feeling* (Harder to fix; must adapt).
  * **Loss Aversion is Key:** Know the scenarios. We are **risk-averse** when facing **gains**, but **risk-seeking** when facing **losses**. This leads to holding losers and selling winners.
  * **Representativeness = Neglect:** This bias includes **base-rate neglect** and **sample-size neglect**.
  * **Commission vs. Omission:** **Regret-aversion** is the fear of **commission** (doing something wrong), which is stronger than the regret of **omission** (doing nothing). This leads to **herding**.
  * **Bubbles:** Bubbles are not one bias, but a cocktail of many, especially Overconfidence, Confirmation, and Regret-Aversion (Herding).
  * **Know the Pairs:**
      * **Status Quo** (doing nothing) and **Endowment** (over-valuing what you own) are very similar.
      * **Overconfidence** is often caused by **Self-Attribution** and **Hindsight** bias.
