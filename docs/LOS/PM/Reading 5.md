# CFA Level 1 Portfolio Management Module 5
## The Behavioral Biases of Individuals

---

### 1. Introduction

Behavioral finance studies how psychological influences and biases affect investor behavior and financial markets. This module helps you recognize, categorize, and manage common behavioral biases‚Äîcrucial for CFA exam scenarios and real-life investing.

---

### 2. Behavioral Bias Categories

Behavioral biases are grouped as **Cognitive Errors** and **Emotional Biases.**
- **Cognitive Errors:** Result from errors in thinking/processing information.
- **Emotional Biases:** Originate from feelings/emotional responses, leading to irrational decisions.

---

### 3. Cognitive Errors

#### A. **Belief Perseverance Biases**
- **Conservatism:** Stick to original views, underweighting new info.
  - *Example (India)*: An investor continues preferring PSU banks, ignoring clear evidence of private banks outperforming.
- **Confirmation Bias:** Seek or notice only info that supports existing beliefs.
  - *MCQ Trick*: Look for answers involving only supporting data‚Äîmissed contradictory facts!

#### B. **Processing Errors**
- **Illusion of Control:** Overestimate your influence over outcomes.
  - *Ex:* Actively trading on Zerodha because you believe ‚Äúyour view‚Äù predicts markets.
- **Representativeness Bias:** Judge probability by how much it resembles a stereotype.
  - *Ex:* Assuming all IPOs will deliver quick returns because of a few high-profile successes.
- **Framing Bias:** React differently depending on the context in which info is presented.
  - *Tip*: Be alert to how choices are ‚Äúframed‚Äù in CFA options.

---

### 4. Emotional Biases

- **Loss-Aversion Bias:** Feel losses more painfully than equivalent gains.
  - *Indian Example:* Not selling a loss-making stock (like Yes Bank at ‚Çπ60) because you ‚Äúcan‚Äôt bear to book the loss.‚Äù
- **Overconfidence Bias:** Overestimate your abilities; trade too much.
  - *Ex:* Frequent F&O traders on Indian exchanges thinking they can outwit the market.
- **Self-Control Bias:** Failure to act in pursuit of long-term goals.
  - *Ex:* Not maintaining SIPs, redeeming mutual funds for discretionary purchases.
- **Status Quo Bias:** Preference for things to stay the same.
  - *Ex:* Indian families sticking to FDs despite better long-term options.
- **Endowment Bias:** Value something more just because you own it.
  - *Ex:* Refusing to sell inherited shares regardless of change in fundamentals.
- **Regret-Aversion Bias:** Avoiding action to prevent "feeling bad" later.
  - *Ex:* Not investing in equity fearing future regret if the market falls.

### 5. Impact on Markets ‚Äì Anomalies

- **Momentum:** Tendency for stocks that perform well to keep doing so for a while (seen with small-cap rallies in India).
- **Bubbles and Crashes:** Results from herd behavior and biases‚Äîremember the Indian real estate bubble pre-2008?
- **Value Anomaly:** Out-of-favor stocks sometimes deliver higher returns (Value funds in Indian mutual fund space).

### 6. Behavioral Biases & Portfolio Management

*Key Exam Angle*:  
- Identify biases in a scenario and recommend specific mitigation strategies, e.g.:
  - Use systematic investment plans (SIPs) to counteract loss aversion.
  - Regular portfolio reviews to overcome status quo bias.

*Indian Context Example*:  
A young professional in Mumbai consistently tries to time the market but loses to SIP investors due to overconfidence and loss-aversion. SIPs force discipline, overcoming biases.

## üî• Exam-Day Quick Pointers

- Learn *all* bias definitions and be able to spot them in scenario-based MCQs.
- Know mitigation strategies: automation (SIP), regular reviews, rules-based approaches.
- Remember, cognitive = errors in thinking; emotional = driven by feelings.
- In India, ‚ÄúFD love‚Äù is often status quo/endowment bias combined.
- CFA questions often frame one answer as ‚Äúbehavioral fix‚Äù‚Äîlook for references to discipline or external controls.
