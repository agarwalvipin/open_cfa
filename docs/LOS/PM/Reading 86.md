## Reading 86: Basics of Portfolio Planning and Construction 🗺️

### 🎯 Introduction

A samurai who charges into battle without a plan is a samurai who will not return. Your investing journey is no different. You cannot just buy stocks and hope for the best. You need a **battle plan**, a blueprint that guides every single decision.

This reading teaches you how to create that master plan, known as the **Investment Policy Statement (IPS)**. This is the most fundamental document in portfolio management. It's the map you create *before* you enter the forest, defining your destination, your risk tolerance, and the path you'll take. Master this, and you'll have the discipline to succeed.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 1: The Investment Policy Statement (IPS) - Your Sacred Scroll (LOS 86.a, 86.b)</span>

The IPS is the written document that governs the entire client relationship.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.1 Why Write It Down? (LOS 86.a)</span>

Why have a *written* IPS?

  * **It's a Master Plan:** It helps you make informed decisions and forces you (and the client) to define your goals.
  * **It Builds Discipline:** It's the "master" you serve. It keeps you from making emotional decisions in a market panic and prevents you from chasing fads.
  * **It's a Contract:** It ensures you and your client have a mutual understanding of the goals and constraints.
  * **It's a Shield:** It's an "instruction manual" for future managers or in case of a dispute, showing the plan was sound and followed.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.2 What's *in* the IPS? (LOS 86.b)</span>

A complete IPS contains several key sections:

1.  **Description of Client:** Who is this person/institution? 
2.  **Statement of Purpose:** What is the goal of this document? 
3.  **Statement of Duties and Responsibilities:** Who does what? (Manager, client, custodian) 
4.  **Procedures:** How will we communicate? How will we handle unexpected events? 
5.  **Investment Objectives:** What is the mission? (Risk and Return) 
6.  **Investment Constraints:** What are the obstacles? (The "L-T-T-L-U" constraints) 
7.  **Strategic Asset Allocation:** What's the long-term "home base" asset mix? 
8.  **Benchmark:** How will we measure success? 

-----

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 2: The Mission - Objectives (LOS 86.c)</span>

This is the core of the plan: What are we trying to achieve (Return) and what are we willing to endure (Risk)?.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.1 Risk Objectives</span>

Risk objectives define how much risk the client can tolerate.

  * **Absolute Risk Objectives:** Stated in *absolute* terms.
      * "Do not lose more than 10% in any 12-month period".
      * "Have a 95% probability of not losing more than $50,000".
  * **Relative Risk Objectives:** Stated *relative to a benchmark*.
      * "Annual return will be within 4% of the S\&P 500".
      * This is often measured by **tracking risk** (the standard deviation of the *difference* in returns between the portfolio and the benchmark).

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.2 Return Objectives</span>

Return objectives state the client's return goals.

  * **Absolute Return Objectives:** Stated as a *specific* target.
      * "Achieve an 8% annualized return".
  * **Relative Return Objectives:** Stated *relative to a benchmark*.
      * "Outperform the FTSE Global Index by 2% per year".

**💡 The Inevitable Conflict**

Remember, high returns and low risk are **mutually exclusive**. A client who wants a 15% return but has a low risk tolerance needs to be educated. Your job is to find a *compatible* set of risk and return objectives.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 3: The Warrior's Mindset - Risk Tolerance (LOS 86.d)</span>

This is one of the most tested concepts in this section. A client's overall risk tolerance is a *combination* of two separate factors:

1.  **Ability to Take Risk (The Wallet):**

      * This is the *financial* capacity to bear risk.
      * Factors: High wealth, stable income, long time horizon, and insurance all *increase* your ability to take risk.
      * It's an objective, financial assessment.

2.  **Willingness to Take Risk (The Stomach):**

      * This is the *psychological* and *emotional* desire to take risk.
      * Factors: It's based on personality, attitudes, and beliefs.
      * It's a subjective, behavioral assessment, often found using questionnaires.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">Handling the Conflict</span>

What happens when ability and willingness don't match?

  * **High Willingness, Low Ability:** The client *wants* to be aggressive but is financially *unable* to.
      * **The Rule:** **Low Ability *always* wins.** You are the disciplined advisor. You must follow the client's low ability and constrain their risk-taking.
  * **Low Willingness, High Ability:** The client is financially *able* to take risk but is *emotionally* scared to.
      * **The Rule:** You can try to *educate* the client about the benefits of taking more risk to meet their goals, but you should not force them. The low willingness is the primary constraint.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 4: The Terrain - Constraints (LOS 86.e)</span>

Constraints are the fences, mountains, and rivers that limit your choices. Every IPS *must* consider them.

<div style="background-color: #E3F2FD; border-left: 5px solid #1976D2; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

**🧠 Samurai Mnemonic: "L-T-T-L-U" (The 5 Constraints)**

  * **L**iquidity
  * **T**ime Horizon
  * **T**ax Situation
  * **L**egal and Regulatory
  * **U**nique Circumstances

</div>
</div>

1.  **Liquidity:** The need for spendable cash. High liquidity needs (e.g., a down payment next year, high ongoing expenses) mean you must hold more cash or safe, liquid assets, which reduces risk and potential return.
2.  **Time Horizon:** The time until the money is needed. A longer time horizon (like for a young person's retirement) *increases* the ability to take risk. A short horizon (like saving for college in 2 years) *decreases* it.
3.  **Tax Situation:** How are investments taxed?  Are capital gains taxed at a lower rate than income?  Are there tax-free accounts? This will heavily influence *which* assets you buy and *where* you put them (asset location).
4.  **Legal and Regulatory:** What laws or rules apply?  (e.g., A trust document might forbid certain investments. An insider cannot trade on non-public information).
5.  **Unique Circumstances:** The catch-all bucket for everything else.
      * Socially Responsible Investing (ESG) preferences.
      * A large, illiquid holding in a family business.
      * A prohibition against investing in certain stocks.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 5: Assembling the Army - Portfolio Construction (LOS 86.f, 86.g)</span>

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">5.1 Specifying Asset Classes (LOS 86.f)</span>

Before you can allocate, you must define your "armies" (asset classes).

> **💡 Classic Exam Rule:** Good asset classes have...
> \* **High correlation *within* the class.** (All "large-cap stocks" should move similarly).
>
>   * **Low correlation *between* classes.** (Stocks and bonds should *not* move together). This is what provides the risk-reduction benefit of diversification.

Asset classes can include traditional (stocks, bonds, cash)  and alternative (real estate, private equity, hedge funds).

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">5.2 Strategic vs. Tactical Allocation (LOS 86.g)</span>

This is the "how-to" of building the portfolio.

  * **Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA):** This is your **long-term, "home base" policy mix**. It's the set of target percentages (e.g., 60% stocks, 40% bonds) that you get by combining the IPS (your objectives/constraints) with the efficient frontier (market expectations). This is the *result* of the planning step.
  * **Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA):** This is a **short-term, *active* deviation** from the SAA. You might *temporarily* shift your portfolio to 65% stocks / 35% bonds because you believe stocks are about to outperform. This is an active strategy that adds risk.
  * **Security Selection:** This is *another* active decision. It's not about changing the 60% stock allocation, but about *which stocks* you choose *within* that 60% (e.g., overweighting energy and underweighting tech).

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 6: A New Battlefield - ESG Considerations (LOS 86.h)</span>

**Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)** factors can be a key part of the "Unique Circumstances" constraint, or a core part of the entire strategy.

Here are the main ways to integrate ESG:

  * **Negative Screening:** *Excluding* certain companies or industries (e.g., no tobacco, no weapons).
  * **Positive Screening / Best-in-Class:** *Actively selecting* companies that are leaders in ESG practices.
  * **Thematic Investing:** Focusing on a single theme, like clean energy or water scarcity.
  * **Impact Investing:** Seeking a *specific*, *measurable* positive impact alongside a financial return.
  * **Engagement / Active Ownership:** Using your shareholder power (voting) to push companies toward better ESG practices.
  * **ESG Integration:** Building ESG factors directly into your financial models as another source of risk or opportunity.

**Key takeaway:** Constraining your investment universe (like with negative screening) *may* affect performance, so your benchmark should also be adjusted to be a fair comparison.

### 🎯 Quick Exam-Day Pointers

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

  * **The IPS is the core document.** It's the written plan that provides discipline.
  * **Ability vs. Willingness:** Know the difference\! **Ability** = financial. **Willingness** = psychological. When they conflict, the *more conservative* of the two (Low Ability or Low Willingness) governs the portfolio.
  * **The 5 Constraints (L-T-T-L-U):** Be able to list and explain **L**iquidity, **T**ime Horizon, **T**axes, **L**egal/Regulatory, and **U**nique Circumstances.
  * **Asset Class Definition:** This is a classic trap\! Good asset classes have **HIGH correlation *within*** the class and **LOW correlation *between*** classes.
  * **SAA vs. TAA:** **S**trategic = **S**et for the long term. **T**actical = **T**emporary shift.
  * **ESG Approaches:** Know the difference between **Negative Screening** (excluding) , **Positive Screening** (including) , and **Impact Investing** (seeking a specific measurable outcome).
