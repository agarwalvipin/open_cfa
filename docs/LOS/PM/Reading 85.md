## Reading 85: Portfolio Management: An Overview ⛩️

### 🎯 Introduction

Greetings, Samurai. You've forged individual weapons—learning about equities, fixed income, and derivatives. Now, you must learn the art of the warrior who carries them. How do you combine these weapons into an arsenal that is perfect for *your* specific mission?

This reading is your introduction to the grand discipline of **portfolio management**. It’s the framework that ties everything together. We'll learn why fighting with one weapon (a single stock) is foolish and how to build a diversified arsenal (a portfolio). We'll also survey the battlefield: the different types of investors and the industry that serves them. Let's begin the high-level strategy\!

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 1: The Process and The People</span>

Before we can build a portfolio, we must understand *why* we're building it and *for whom*.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.1 The Portfolio Approach (LOS 85.a)</span>

The very first lesson a samurai learns is to never be caught off guard. The **portfolio perspective** is your armor.

  * **The Flawed Approach:** Evaluating an investment in isolation (e.g., "This stock is great, I'll put all my money in it\!"). This is reckless, as it ignores how the asset *interacts* with your other holdings.
  * **The Samurai Approach:** Evaluating individual investments by their **contribution to the risk and return of the entire portfolio**.
  * **The Grand Prize: Diversification:** This is your core defense. By combining assets that are not perfectly correlated, you can **reduce your total portfolio risk without sacrificing expected return**. This is the closest thing to a "free lunch" in finance.
      * **Diversification Ratio:** We can measure this benefit. It's the ratio of a portfolio's risk (standard deviation) to the weighted average risk of the individual securities. A lower ratio means greater risk reduction.
      * **A Warning:** Diversification works best in *normal* markets. During a financial crisis, correlations often rise, and this benefit can be reduced.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.2 The 3-Step Portfolio Management Process (LOS 85.b)</span>

Every mission, every portfolio, follows a disciplined, three-step loop.

1.  **The Planning Step:** This is where you create your battle plan, the **Investment Policy Statement (IPS)**. This is the most crucial step. You analyze the client's risk tolerance, return objectives, and all constraints (covered in Reading 86).
2.  **The Execution Step:** This is where you act on the plan.
      * **Asset Allocation:** You decide the broad mix of assets (e.g., 60% stocks, 40% bonds) based on the IPS and your market forecasts (a "top-down" view).
      * **Security Selection:** You choose the specific securities *within* each asset class (e.g., which stocks to buy) based on valuation (a "bottom-up" view).
3.  **The Feedback Step:** The battle is never over. You must constantly monitor and adapt.
      * **Monitoring & Rebalancing:** You watch the portfolio and bring it back in line with the IPS if the allocations drift too far.
      * **Performance Evaluation:** You measure your results against the benchmark defined in the IPS to see if your strategy is working.

**🧠 Samurai Mnemonic: "Plan, Execute, Feedback" (P-E-F)**

  * **P**lan the fight (Planning / IPS).
  * **E**xecute the plan (Execution / Asset Allocation & Security Selection).
  * **F**eedback on the results (Feedback / Monitoring & Performance).

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.3 Types of Investors (LOS 85.c)</span>

You must know who you are fighting for. Every client is different.

  * **Individual Investors:** People saving for various goals like retirement, a house, or their children's education. Their characteristics (risk tolerance, time horizon, etc.) are unique to each person.
  * **Institutional Investors:** These are large organizations managing pools of money.
      * **Endowments:** Funds that support a *specific purpose* (like a university) indefinitely. They typically have a **long time horizon** and **high risk tolerance**.
      * **Foundations:** Funds established for *charitable* purposes. Similar to endowments, they have a **long time horizon** and **high risk tolerance**.
      * **Banks:** Manage money to earn a spread. They have **low risk tolerance** and **high liquidity needs** to meet depositor withdrawals.
      * **Insurance Companies:** Also have **low risk tolerance** and **high liquidity needs** to pay claims.
      * **Defined Benefit Pension Plans:** (See below). Typically **high risk tolerance** and **long-term**.
      * **Mutual Funds:** (See below). Characteristics *depend on the fund's stated goal*.
      * **Sovereign Wealth Funds:** Government-owned investment funds.

**Investor Characteristics Summary Table** 

| Investor | Risk Tolerance | Investment Horizon | Liquidity Needs | Income Needs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Individuals** | Depends | Depends | Depends | Depends |
| **Banks** | Low | Short | High | Pay Interest |
| **Endowments** | High | Long | Low | Spending Level |
| **Insurance** | Low | Long/Short | High | Low |
| **Mutual Funds** | Depends on fund | Depends on fund | High | Depends on fund |
| **Defined Benefit** | High | Long | Low | Depends on age |

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.4 Pension Plans: DC vs. DB (LOS 85.d)</span>

This is a critical, highly testable distinction. Who bears the risk?

  * **Defined Contribution (DC) Plan:**
      * **What it is:** The firm contributes a certain amount (e.g., 5% of your salary) to your retirement account *each period*.
      * **Who bears the risk:** **The employee**. You choose the investments, and your final retirement benefit depends entirely on how well your investments perform. The firm makes *no promise* about the final value.
  * **Defined Benefit (DB) Plan:**
      * **What it is:** The firm *promises* you a specific payment *after you retire* (e.g., 2% of your final salary for each year of service).
      * **Who bears the risk:** **The employer** (plan sponsor). The firm must manage a pool of assets to ensure it can meet these future promises. If the investments do poorly, the *firm* is on the hook to make up the difference.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 2: The Industry & Investment Vehicles</span>

This is the world you are entering—the firms that manage money and the products they create.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.1 The Asset Management Industry (LOS 85.e)</span>

  * **Buy-Side vs. Sell-Side:**
      * **Buy-Side:** The "buyers" of investments. These are asset managers, pension funds, etc., that manage money for clients.
      * **Sell-Side:** The "sellers" or service providers. These are brokers and investment banks that sell securities and research to the buy-side.
  * **Active vs. Passive Management:**
      * **Active:** The manager is actively trying to *beat* a benchmark (e.g., the S\&P 500) through security selection or market timing. This costs more (higher fees).
      * **Passive:** The manager tries to *replicate* a benchmark (e.g., an S\&P 500 index fund). This is cheaper (lower fees). The market share for passive management has been growing.
  * **Traditional vs. Alternative:**
      * **Traditional Managers:** Focus on stocks and bonds.
      * **Alternative Managers:** Focus on private equity, hedge funds, real estate, commodities, etc.. Profit margins here are typically higher.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.2 Pooled Investments: The Army (LOS 85.f)</span>

Pooled investments are vehicles that combine funds from many investors into a single portfolio.

  * **Mutual Funds:** The classic example.

      * **Open-End Funds:** The most common type. Investors buy/sell shares *directly from the fund* at the **Net Asset Value (NAV)** at the end of the trading day. The fund grows or shrinks as investors move money in and out.
      * **Closed-End Funds:** The fund has a *fixed number of shares* that are issued in an IPO and then trade on a stock exchange *like a stock*. The price is set by the market and can be at a **premium or discount** to its NAV.

  * **Types of Mutual Funds:**

      * **Money Market Funds:** Invest in short-term, low-risk debt.
      * **Bond Funds:** Invest in fixed income, sorted by maturity, credit quality, etc..
      * **Stock Funds:** Can be **index funds** (passive) or **actively managed** (growth, value, etc.).

  * **Comparing Other Pooled Investments:**

      * **Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs):** Like a mutual fund, but trade *throughout the day* on an exchange like a closed-end fund. They are typically low-cost, tax-efficient, and often passively managed.
      * **Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs):** A portfolio owned by *one single investor* and managed to their specific needs. No shares are issued. For high-net-worth individuals.
      * **Hedge Funds:** Lightly regulated pools for *qualified* (wealthy) investors. Use complex strategies, leverage, and short-selling. Have high minimum investments.
      * **Private Equity / Venture Capital:** Invest in private companies, often taking an active role in management, with the goal of selling them later.

### 🎯 Quick Exam-Day Pointers

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

  * **Portfolio Perspective:** The #1 concept. Judge investments by their impact on the *total portfolio's* risk/return, not in isolation.
  * **The 3 Steps (P-E-F):** **P**lanning (IPS), **E**xecution (Asset Allocation/Security Selection), **F**eedback (Monitoring/Rebalancing).
  * **DC vs. DB:** This is a guaranteed concept.
      * **DC Plan:** **E**mployee bears the **C**rap (risk).
      * **DB Plan:** **E**mployer bears the **B**urden (risk).
  * **Open vs. Closed Funds:**
      * **Open-End:** Trades *once* a day at NAV *with the fund*.
      * **Closed-End:** Trades *all day* at a market price *on an exchange*.
  * **Active vs. Passive:** **Active** = Beat the benchmark (high fees). **Passive** = Match the benchmark (low fees).
  * **Investor Types:** Know the table\! Endowments/Foundations = High risk tolerance, long-term. Banks/Insurance = Low risk tolerance, high liquidity.
