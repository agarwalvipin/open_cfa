# CFA Level 1 Portfolio Management 6
## Introduction to Risk Management

---

### 1. Introduction

Risk management is the practice of identifying, assessing, and addressing all types of risks an individual or institution faces in the context of investing and business. For CFA candidates and future finance professionals, strong risk management skills are essential for portfolio construction and long-term client success.

### 2. The Risk Management Process

#### The Standard Four-Step Process:
1. **Identify the Risk**
   - What could go wrong? (e.g., stock market crash, currency devaluation, fraud)
2. **Measure and Assess the Risk**
   - Quantify: How likely are these risks? How big could the loss be? (Use stats, standard deviation, VaR, scenario analysis.)
3. **Manage and Mitigate the Risk**
   - Decide: Accept, avoid, transfer (buy insurance), or mitigate (diversification, stop-loss orders).
4. **Monitor and Review**
   - Continually reassess risks as circumstances change (e.g., new RBI regulation, client‚Äôs job status).

#### *Indian Example*:  
A mutual fund in Mumbai assesses portfolio exposure to USD/INR currency movements if it invests internationally.

#### *<mark>EXAM TIP:</mark>*:  
Process order is frequently tested. Don‚Äôt mix up risk *identification* with risk *assessment*.

### 3. The Risk Management Framework

- **Risk Governance & Enterprise View:**
  - Board/investment committee sets policy.
  - Ensures all risks considered at the highest level.
  - *Example:* Indian banks set lending limits and review all big loans.

#### *Exam Pointer*:  
Terms like "enterprise risk management (ERM)" and "risk governance" signal board or top management responsibility.

---

### 4. Risk Tolerance

- **Definition:** The amount of risk an entity/investor *willing* and *able* to accept to meet objectives.
  - *Willingness*: Linked to attitude and preference.
  - *Ability*: Linked to financial strength (e.g., a pension fund can take more risk than a retiree).
- Mismatch between willingness and ability? The more *conservative* should dominate. (Often a classic CFA MCQ.)

---

### 5. Risk Budgeting

- Allocating total risk to various strategies or asset classes.
  - *Example (India):* A portfolio is limited to no more than 20% in mid-cap equity, capped at 10% sectoral bets, etc.
- Methods: Value-at-Risk (VaR) ‚Äúbudget,‚Äù volatility limits, maximum drawdown.

---

### 6. Types of Risk

#### Financial Risks:
- **Market Risk:** Volatility in equity, interest rates, commodity, or currencies (e.g., Nifty drops, gold prices spike)
- **Credit Risk:** Borrowers defaulting (e.g., NBFC crisis)
- **Liquidity Risk:** Can‚Äôt sell an asset quickly at fair value (e.g., micro-cap Indian shares)
- **Leverage Risk:** Using borrowed money magnifies gains/losses.

#### Non-Financial Risks:
- **Operational Risk:** Failures in systems/processes (fraud, cyberattacks)
- **Legal/Compliance Risk:** Regulatory changes or lawsuits
- **Model Risk:** Inaccurate predictions (VaR doesn‚Äôt capture Black Swan events)
- **Reputation Risk:** Bad press (e.g., bank fraud scandal)

#### *Exam Focus*:  
Be able to match risk types with the right definition or scenario.

### 7. Measuring & Modifying Risk

- **Drivers**: Key factors influencing risk.
- **Metrics**: How you quantify it (e.g., stdev, beta, VaR).
- **Risk Modification Techniques:**
  - *Prevention/Avoidance*: Don‚Äôt invest at all (avoid penny stocks)
  - *Acceptance*: Live with the risk, self-insure (keep some cash buffer)
  - *Diversification*: Spread investments
  - *Transfer*: Insurance, derivatives (puts/calls, forwards)
  - *Shifting*: Change portfolio allocation when risk is high (raise cash in bear market)

### 8. Quick Table: Risk Modification Methods

| Method        | Description                                      | Indian Example                  |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Avoidance     | Don‚Äôt take the risk at all                       | Do not invest in crypto         |
| Acceptance    | Willingly bear small risks                       | Accept market volatility in SIP |
| Diversification| Spread exposure to many assets                   | Equity + bonds + gold fund      |
| Transfer      | Shift cost to another party                      | Buy health/term insurance; options hedging in stocks |
| Shifting      | Adjust exposure strategically                    | Move to debt from equity ahead of elections             |

## üî• Exam-Day Quick Pointers

- Know all four steps of the risk management process *in order*.
- Differentiate financial vs. non-financial risks (and examples for each).
- Always recommend the ‚Äúmost conservative‚Äù risk tolerance if there‚Äôs a conflict.
- For risk reduction, remember: **Avoid ‚Äì Accept ‚Äì Diversify ‚Äì Transfer**.
- Indian MCQs often wrap questions in a corporate or mutual fund scenario; think how these risk concepts are applied locally.

## üìí Key Formulas

Most risk management at Level 1 is conceptual, but review:
- **Standard deviation (volatility)**: \( \sigma \)
- **Value at Risk (VaR)**
- **Beta (systematic risk)**
