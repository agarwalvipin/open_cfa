## Reading 47: Fixed-Income Instrument Features

### üéØ Introduction

Think of a bond as a very formal IOU. When a large entity like the Government of India or a company like Apple needs to borrow a lot of money, they can't just ask a single bank. Instead, they issue bonds, which are essentially small slices of a giant loan that many different people can buy. This reading is the "user manual" for these IOUs. We'll break down all the essential parts: **Issuer**, **Maturity**, **Principal**, **Coupon**, **Seniority**, **Contingency Provisions**, and **Yield**. Understanding these features is the first step to becoming a fixed-income expert!

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 1: Core Features of a Bond (LOS 47.a)</span>

Every bond, whether issued by a government or a corporation, has a set of core features that define it. Think of these as the bond's DNA.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.1 Issuer</span>
* **Issuer:** Who is borrowing the money. Major issuers include:
  * **Sovereign Governments:** National governments like the U.S. government issuing Treasury bonds or the Government of India issuing G-Secs.
  * **Corporations:** Companies like Tata Motors or Microsoft borrowing for expansion.
  * **Local Governments:** States or cities (municipalities) borrowing for public projects.
  * **Supranational Entities:** Organizations like the World Bank or International Monetary Fund.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.2 Maturity (Tenor)</span>
* **Maturity (or Tenor):** The date when the issuer must repay the principal amount.
  * **Money Market Securities:** Bonds with original maturities of one year or less.
  * **Capital Market Securities:** Bonds with original maturities longer than one year.
  * **Perpetual Bonds:** Rare bonds with no maturity date, theoretically paying interest forever.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.3 Principal (Par Value or Face Value)</span>
* **Principal (Par Value or Face Value):** The amount the issuer agrees to repay at maturity.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.4 Coupon Rate & Frequency</span>
* **Coupon Rate & Frequency:** The **coupon rate** is the annual interest rate paid on the bond's par value.
  * **Fixed-Coupon:** Pays a constant interest rate throughout its life.  
    *Example:* A $1,000 par value bond with a 5% coupon paid semi-annually pays $25 every six months.
  * **Floating-Rate Notes (FRNs):** Interest rate resets periodically based on a **market reference rate (MRR)** (like SOFR) plus a fixed margin. Protects investors when rates rise.
  * **Zero-Coupon Bonds:** Pay no interest. Sold at a deep discount; return comes from the difference between purchase price and par value at maturity.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.5 Seniority</span>
* **Seniority:** Determines order of repayment if issuer goes bankrupt.
  * **Senior Debt:** Gets paid first. ‚úÖ Less risky.
  * **Junior (Subordinated) Debt:** Paid after senior debtholders. ‚ùå Riskier, higher yield.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.6 Contingency Provisions (Embedded Options)</span>
* **Contingency Provisions:** Special clauses allowing issuer/investor to take specific actions (e.g., issuer's right to repay early‚Äîcall option).

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.7 Price vs. Yield Relationship ‚öñÔ∏è</span>
A bond's **yield** is the total return if held to maturity. For fixed-coupon bonds, remember the **inverse relationship** between price and yield:
* If a bond's price goes **UP** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è, its yield goes **DOWN** ‚¨áÔ∏è.
* If a bond's price goes **DOWN** ‚¨áÔ∏è, its yield goes **UP** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è.

Why? If you buy a bond paying a fixed $50 coupon for a cheaper price ($950 vs $1,000), your overall return (yield) is higher.

This relationship is visualized in a **yield curve**, which plots yields against maturities.  
* **Normal yield curve:** Slopes upward‚Äîlonger-term bonds have higher yields (higher risk).
* **Inverted yield curve:** Slopes downward‚Äîcan signal an upcoming recession.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 2: The Bond Indenture & Repayment Sources (LOS 47.b)</span>

The **bond indenture** is the master legal contract detailing all rights of bondholders and obligations of the issuer.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.1 Sources of Repayment</span>
* **Secured Bonds:** Backed by specific assets (**collateral**) that can be sold to repay bondholders if issuer defaults.
* **Unsecured Bonds:** Backed only by issuer's general promise and ability to generate cash flow. ‚ùå Riskier than secured bonds.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.2 Bond Covenants: The Dos and Don'ts</span>
Covenants are rules placed on the issuer to protect bondholders. Two types:

##### <span style="color: #E65100;">2.2.1 Affirmative Covenants ‚úÖ</span>
Things the issuer *promises to do*:
* Make timely interest and principal payments.
* Provide audited financial statements.
* Maintain assets and carry insurance.
* **Pari Passu Clause:** Bond has same priority as other senior debt.
* **Cross-Default Clause:** If issuer defaults on any other debt, considered in default on this bond.

##### <span style="color: #E65100;">2.2.2 Negative Covenants ‚ùå</span>
Things the issuer *is restricted from doing*:
* **Restrictions on Debt:** Cannot issue new debt senior to existing bonds (**negative pledge clause**).
* **Restrictions on Asset Sales:** Cannot sell major assets needed for repayment.
* **Restrictions on Payments to Shareholders:** Cannot pay excessive dividends or buy back large amounts of stock.

**üí° CFA Exam Tip ‚úçÔ∏è:** The distinction between **affirmative (must do)** and **negative (cannot do)** covenants is a classic exam topic. **Negative covenants** are the primary way bondholders protect themselves from the issuer taking on more risk after the bond has been issued.

### üéØ Quick Exam-Day Pointers

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

* **The Core Features:** Be able to describe the 7 key features of a bond: **Issuer**, **Maturity**, **Par Value**, **Coupon**, **Seniority**, **Contingency Provisions**, and **Yield**.
* **Price-Yield Seesaw:** The most important relationship in fixed income is **INVERSE**. When price goes up ‚¨ÜÔ∏è, yield goes down ‚¨áÔ∏è, and vice versa. This is a guaranteed concept on the exam.
* **Covenants:** Know the difference between **affirmative covenants** (what the issuer MUST do ‚úÖ) and **negative covenants** (what the issuer CANNOT do ‚ùå). Negative covenants are the bondholder's main defense.
* **Secured vs. Unsecured:** **Secured bonds** are backed by collateral and are safer ‚úÖ than **unsecured bonds**, which are backed only by the issuer's promise ‚ùå.
