## Reading 62: Credit Analysis for Corporate Issuers 👔

🎯 **Introduction**

Before a bank gives you a personal loan, they want to see your payslips, check your credit score, and look at your other debts. Credit analysis for a corporation is the exact same idea, just on a much grander scale. This reading is our guide to looking "under the hood" of a company to assess its ability to repay its debts. We'll learn to evaluate both the company's story (**qualitative factors**) and its financial health (**quantitative factors**). We'll also see why not all debt is created equal, by exploring the strict pecking order (**seniority**) that determines who gets paid first if a company goes bankrupt.

### Part 1: The Analyst's Toolkit: Qualitative & Quantitative Factors 🛠️

A thorough credit analysis involves looking beyond the numbers to understand the business and its environment.

#### **Qualitative Factors (The Story Behind the Numbers)**

* **Business Model:** Does the company have a stable, predictable way of making money? A company like Nestlé, selling consumer staples, has a more stable business model than a highly cyclical steel manufacturer.
* **Industry Competition:** Is the company in a cutthroat industry with low margins, or does it operate in an industry with high barriers to entry, giving it pricing power? Less competition is better for credit quality.
* **Business Risk:** How sensitive is the business to economic cycles? Utility companies are generally recession-proof, while luxury car makers are highly cyclical.
* **Corporate Governance:** This is a huge factor! Does management run the company for the benefit of all stakeholders, or do they favor shareholders at the expense of bondholders?
    * **Red Flags 🚩:** A history of debt-funded share buybacks, aggressive accounting policies, or a management team with a reputation for putting shareholders first are all warning signs for a credit analyst.

#### **Quantitative Factors (The Hard Numbers)**

This involves forecasting a company's financial performance to assess its ability to generate the cash needed to pay its debts. Analysts use several measures of cash flow, including:
* **EBITDA:** Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization.
* **CFO:** Cash Flow from Operating Activities (from the cash flow statement).
* **FFO:** Funds from Operations (CFO excluding changes in working capital).
* **RCF:** Retained Cash Flow (CFO minus dividends).

These cash flow measures are then used in key financial ratios.

### Part 2: The Four Key Ratio Categories 📊

Credit analysts use a core set of financial ratios to assess a company's capacity to service its debt.

| Ratio Type | Ratio Name | Calculation | Indication of Higher Credit Quality |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Profitability** | EBIT Margin | EBIT / Revenue | Higher ratio ✅ |
| **Coverage** | EBIT / Interest Expense | EBIT / Interest Expense | Higher ratio ✅ |
| **Leverage** | Debt to EBITDA | Debt / EBITDA | Lower ratio ✅ |
| **Leverage** | RCF to Net Debt | RCF / (Debt - Cash) | Higher ratio ✅ |

Example: Comparing Two Companies

By comparing these key ratios between two companies in the same industry, an analyst can quickly get a sense of their relative creditworthiness. A company with higher margins, better interest coverage, and lower leverage is generally the better credit risk.

### Part 3: Not All Debt is Created Equal: Seniority & Notching 🪜

In a bankruptcy, a company's assets are liquidated to pay back creditors. However, there is a strict legal pecking order, or **priority of claims**, that determines who gets paid first. A bond's rank in this structure is its **seniority**.

#### **The Pecking Order**

The general seniority ranking from highest priority (safest) to lowest priority (riskiest) is:

1.  **First Lien / First Mortgage Debt:** A type of **secured debt** backed by a primary claim on specific collateral.
2.  **Senior Secured Debt:** Backed by a secondary claim on collateral.
3.  **Senior Unsecured Debt:** Not backed by specific collateral, but has a senior claim on the company's general assets. This is the most common type of bond for investment-grade issuers.
4.  **Senior Subordinated Debt**
5.  **Subordinated Debt**
6.  **Junior Subordinated Debt:** These lower-ranking types of **unsecured debt** get paid only after all senior claims have been satisfied.

Debt within the same category is said to rank **pari passu**, meaning all creditors in that class are treated equally.

#### **Issuer vs. Issue Ratings & Notching**

* **Issuer Credit Rating (or Corporate Family Rating):** This is the rating agency's overall credit rating for a company, typically reflecting the risk of its **senior unsecured** debt.
* **Issue Credit Rating:** This is the rating for a *specific* bond issue.
* **Notching:** This is the practice by rating agencies of adjusting a specific bond's rating up or down from the main issuer rating based on its seniority.
    * A first-lien secured bond might be "notched up" one or two levels above the issuer rating.
    * A subordinated bond will be "notched down" below the issuer rating.

> [!TIP]
> **CFA Exam Tip ✍️:** The concept of **structural subordination** is also a reason for notching. If a parent holding company has debt, its claim on a subsidiary's cash flows is *subordinate* to the subsidiary's own debt. Therefore, the parent company's bonds are effectively junior to the subsidiary's bonds.

### 🧪 Formula Summary

* **EBIT Margin:** $\frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{Revenue}}$
* **Interest Coverage:** $\frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{Interest Expense}}$
* **Leverage:** $\frac{\text{Debt}}{\text{EBITDA}}$
* **Cash Flow Leverage:** $\frac{\text{Retained Cash Flow}}{\text{Net Debt}}$

>
> * **Analysis is Two-Sided:** A good credit analysis includes both **qualitative** factors (like business risk and corporate governance) and **quantitative** factors (financial ratios).
> * **The 4 Key Ratio Types:** Focus on a company's **Profitability**, **Coverage** (ability to pay interest), and **Leverage** (level of debt).
> * **Seniority Rules:** In a bankruptcy, **secured debt gets paid before unsecured debt**, and **senior debt gets paid before subordinated debt**. Know the priority of claims.
> * **Notching Reflects Seniority:** A bond's specific rating (**issue rating**) can be "notched" up or down from the company's main **issuer rating** to reflect its position in the capital structure.
