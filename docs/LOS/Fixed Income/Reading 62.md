## Reading 62: Credit Analysis for Corporate Issuers üëî

### üéØ Introduction

Before a bank gives you a personal loan, they want to see your payslips, check your credit score, and look at your other debts. **Credit analysis for a corporation** is the exact same idea, just on a much grander scale. This reading is our guide to looking "under the hood" of a company to assess its ability to repay its debts. We'll learn to evaluate both the company's story (**qualitative factors**) and its financial health (**quantitative factors**). We'll also see why not all debt is created equal, by exploring the strict pecking order (**seniority**) that determines who gets paid first if a company goes bankrupt.

A thorough credit analysis involves looking beyond the numbers to understand the business and its environment.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.1 Qualitative Factors (The Story Behind the Numbers)</span>

* **Business Model:** Does the company have a stable, predictable way of making money? A company like Nestl√©, selling consumer staples, has a more stable business model than a highly cyclical steel manufacturer.
* **Industry Competition:** Is the company in a cutthroat industry with low margins, or does it operate in an industry with high barriers to entry, giving it pricing power? Less competition is better for credit quality.
* **Business Risk:** How sensitive is the business to economic cycles? Utility companies are generally recession-proof, while luxury car makers are highly cyclical.
* **Corporate Governance:** This is a huge factor! Does management run the company for the benefit of all stakeholders, or do they favor shareholders at the expense of bondholders?
  * **Red Flags üö©:** A history of debt-funded share buybacks, aggressive accounting policies, or a management team with a reputation for putting shareholders first are all warning signs for a credit analyst.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.2 Quantitative Factors (The Hard Numbers)</span>

This involves forecasting a company's financial performance to assess its ability to generate the cash needed to pay its debts. Analysts use several measures of cash flow, including:

* **EBITDA:** Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization.
* **CFO:** Cash Flow from Operating Activities (from the cash flow statement).
* **FFO:** Funds from Operations (CFO excluding changes in working capital).
* **RCF:** Retained Cash Flow (CFO minus dividends).

These cash flow measures are then used in key financial ratios.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 2: The Four Key Ratio Categories üìä (LOS 62.b)</span>

Credit analysts use a core set of financial ratios to assess a company's capacity to service its debt.

| Ratio Type      | Ratio Name           | Calculation           | Indication of Higher Credit Quality |
| :---            | :---                | :---                  | :---                               |
| **Profitability** | EBIT Margin         | EBIT / Revenue        | Higher ratio ‚úÖ                     |
| **Coverage**     | EBIT / Interest Expense | EBIT / Interest Expense | Higher ratio ‚úÖ                 |
| **Leverage**     | Debt to EBITDA      | Debt / EBITDA         | Lower ratio ‚úÖ                      |
| **Leverage**     | RCF to Net Debt     | RCF / (Debt - Cash)   | Higher ratio ‚úÖ                     |

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

**üí° CFA Exam Tip ‚úçÔ∏è:** By comparing these key ratios between two companies in the same industry, an analyst can quickly get a sense of their relative creditworthiness. A company with higher margins, better interest coverage, and lower leverage is generally the better credit risk.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 3: Not All Debt is Created Equal: Seniority & Notching ü™ú (LOS 62.c)</span>

In a bankruptcy, a company's assets are liquidated to pay back creditors. However, there is a strict legal pecking order, or **priority of claims**, that determines who gets paid first. A bond's rank in this structure is its **seniority**.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">3.1 The Pecking Order</span>

The general seniority ranking from highest priority (safest) to lowest priority (riskiest) is:

1.  **First Lien / First Mortgage Debt:** A type of **secured debt** backed by a primary claim on specific collateral.
2.  **Senior Secured Debt:** Backed by a secondary claim on collateral.
3.  **Senior Unsecured Debt:** Not backed by specific collateral, but has a senior claim on the company's general assets. This is the most common type of bond for investment-grade issuers.
4.  **Senior Subordinated Debt**
5.  **Subordinated Debt**
6.  **Junior Subordinated Debt:** These lower-ranking types of **unsecured debt** get paid only after all senior claims have been satisfied.

* Debt within the same category is said to rank **pari passu**, meaning all creditors in that class are treated equally.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">3.2 Issuer vs. Issue Ratings & Notching</span>

* **Issuer Credit Rating (or Corporate Family Rating):** This is the rating agency's overall credit rating for a company, typically reflecting the risk of its **senior unsecured** debt.
* **Issue Credit Rating:** This is the rating for a *specific* bond issue.
* **Notching:** This is the practice by rating agencies of adjusting a specific bond's rating up or down from the main issuer rating based on its seniority.
  * A first-lien secured bond might be "notched up" one or two levels above the issuer rating.
  * A subordinated bond will be "notched down" below the issuer rating.

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

**üí° CFA Exam Tip ‚úçÔ∏è:** The concept of **structural subordination** is also a reason for notching. If a parent holding company has debt, its claim on a subsidiary's cash flows is *subordinate* to the subsidiary's own debt. Therefore, the parent company's bonds are effectively junior to the subsidiary's bonds.

* **Analysis is Two-Sided:** A good credit analysis includes both **qualitative** factors (like business risk and corporate governance) and **quantitative** factors (financial ratios).
* **The 4 Key Ratio Types:** Focus on a company's **Profitability**, **Coverage** (ability to pay interest), and **Leverage** (level of debt).
* **Seniority Rules:** In a bankruptcy, **secured debt gets paid before unsecured debt**, and **senior debt gets paid before subordinated debt**. Know the priority of claims.
* **Notching Reflects Seniority:** A bond's specific rating (**issue rating**) can be "notched" up or down from the company's main **issuer rating** to reflect its position in the capital structure.
