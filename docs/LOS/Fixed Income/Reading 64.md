## Reading 64: Asset-Backed Security (ABS) Instrument and Market Features ðŸš—ðŸ’³

### ðŸŽ¯ Introduction

Last reading, we learned the "why" and "how" of securitizationâ€”the process of turning illiquid loans into tradable bonds. Now, we dive into the specific *types* of bonds this machine creates.

This reading covers the major non-mortgage ABS sectors. We'll look at bonds backed by everything from car payments to credit card debt. We'll also master **credit enhancement** (how to build a safer bond) and demystify **Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs)**. This is where you learn to analyze the "plumbing" of a structured security.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 1: Covered Bonds - The "ABS-Like" Cousin (LOS 64.a)</span>

Before we jump into true ABS, we need to meet a close relative: the **covered bond**. These are very popular in Europe.

A covered bond is a senior debt obligation issued directly by a financial institution (like a bank). Like an ABS, it is backed by a pool of high-quality assets (the "cover pool"), which is typically composed of mortgages or public sector loans.

**The CRITICAL Difference from ABS:**

| Feature | Asset-Backed Security (ABS) | Covered Bond |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Balance Sheet** | Assets are **SOLD** to an SPE and are **OFF** the originator's balance sheet. | Assets **REMAIN ON** the issuer's balance sheet. |
| **Legal Recourse** | Investor has recourse **ONLY** to the assets in the SPE. If the pool defaults, you're out of luck. | Investor has **DUAL RECOURSE**. You have a claim on the cover pool *AND* a senior claim on the issuer itself. |
| **Risk** | Higher risk (but higher yield) because you only have one source of repayment. | Considered *much safer* (but lower yield) due to the dual recourse. The issuer must also replace non-performing assets in the pool to keep it "topped up". |

Because covered bonds are so safe, they are often rated AAA and are a key funding tool for banks.

**Types of Covered Bonds (Based on Default Treatment):**

Covered bonds have different rules for what happens if the issuer fails to make a scheduled payment:

  * **Hard-Bullet Covered Bond:** This is the strictest type. It is considered in default immediately if the issuer fails to make a scheduled payment.
  * **Soft-Bullet Covered Bond:** This type has more flexibility. It allows the issuer to postpone the original maturity date (by up to a year, for example) if they miss the payment. This effectively postpones the default.
  * **Conditional Pass-Through Covered Bond:** This type converts into a pass-through security on its maturity date if payments are still due. This means any cash flows subsequently recovered from the cover pool are simply "passed through" to the investors as they are received.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 2: Building a Safer Bond - Credit Enhancements (LOS 64.b)</span>

How do you take a pool of risky loans and create a AAA-rated bond? By using **credit enhancements**â€”structural features designed to protect investors from losses. These are divided into two types.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.1 Internal Credit Enhancements (Built-in)</span>

These are the most common and important.

1.  **Subordination (or Credit Tranching):** This is the #1 method. The SPE issues bonds in different classes, or "tranches," which have a strict priority of payment.

      * **Senior Tranche (e.g., Class A):** Gets paid first. Has the highest credit rating (often AAA) and the lowest yield.
      * **Mezzanine Tranche (e.g., Class B):** Gets paid after Class A is fully paid.
      * **Junior/Equity Tranche (e.g., Class C):** Gets paid last.
      * **The Waterfall:** In a default, the Junior tranche absorbs 100% of the losses first. Only when it is completely wiped out do the Mezzanine tranches begin to take losses. The Senior tranche is safe unless *all* the lower tranches are wiped out.

2.  **Overcollateralization:** The SPE issues bonds with a face value *less than* the value of the collateral.

      * *Example:* The SPE buys `$100` million in auto loans but only issues `$90` million in ABS bonds. That `$10` million "equity" cushion is overcollateralization, protecting investors from the first 10% of defaults.

3.  **Excess Spread (or Excess Interest):** This is the "first-loss" buffer, built in every month.

      * *Example:* The underlying auto loans pay an average of 9% interest.
      * The ABS bonds only promised to pay investors an average of 5% interest.
      * The 4% difference is the **excess spread**. This extra cash flow is kept in a reserve account to absorb any loan defaults that happen that month.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.2 External Credit Enhancements (From a 3rd Party)</span>

These are less common and involve hiring an outside company to provide security.

  * **Surety Bonds / Guarantees:** A third-party insurer (a "monoline insurer") promises to make payments to the ABS investors if the collateral pool fails.
  * **Letters of Credit (LOC):** A bank provides a promise to lend money to the SPE to cover any shortfalls.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 3: The "Non-Mortgage" ABS World (LOS 64.c)</span>

While mortgages (MBS) are the largest ABS sector, many others exist. You need to know the two biggest.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1. Auto Loan ABS</span>

  * **Collateral:** A pool of auto loans.
  * **Cash Flows:** Come from car owners' monthly payments, which include both principal and interest.
  * **Key Feature:** These are **amortizing loans**, meaning the principal balance is paid down over time.
  * **Risk:** Prepayment risk is a factor (people sell their cars or pay off loans early), but it's *much lower* and more predictable than in mortgages. The main risk is **credit risk** (defaults), which is protected by the enhancements we discussed.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2. Credit Card Receivable ABS</span>

  * **Collateral:** A pool of balances from credit card accounts.
  * **Key Feature:** This is a pool of **non-amortizing loans**. The principal balance doesn't automatically decline. As long as people keep using their cards, the balances revolve.
  * **Structure:** Because the balances aren't paid off in a predictable way, these ABS have a special structure:
    1.  **Lockout Period (or Revolving Period):** For the first few years, investors receive *only* interest payments. Any principal that *is* paid off by cardholders is used by the SPE to buy new credit card receivables, keeping the pool balance stable.
    2.  **Amortization Period:** After the lockout, the structure starts paying principal to investors, either in a lump sum or over a short period.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 4: Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) (LOS 64.d)</span>

A **CDO** is a type of ABS, but with a key difference: its collateral is *another pool of debt securities*.

  * **Collateralized Bond Obligations (CBOs):** Collateral is a pool of corporate bonds (often high-yield "junk" bonds).
  * **Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs):** Collateral is a pool of **leveraged bank loans** (loans to heavily indebted companies).

**Key CDO Feature: The Collateral Manager**
Unlike a simple auto loan ABS (which is a static pool), a CDO is **actively managed**. The SPE hires a "Collateral Manager" whose job is to actively buy and sell securities within the collateral pool to maximize returns for the CDO investors.

**CDO Structures:**

  * **Cash Flow CDO:** Investors are paid from the cash flows (interest and principal) generated by the underlying bonds or loans. This is the most common type.
  * **Market Value CDO:** Investors are paid from the *sale* of assets in the collateral pool. The manager must sell assets to pay the bills, relying on market price appreciation.
  * **Synthetic CDO:** These don't own the actual assets. They get exposure using derivatives, like **credit default swaps**.

**ðŸ’¡ Exam Tip: CLOs vs. CDOs**

CLOs are a *type* of CDO, but they are very different from the "CDOs" that famously caused the 2008 financial crisis (which were often CBOs backed by subprime mortgage bonds). CLOs (backed by leveraged loans) have historically had very strong performance and far fewer defaults.

### ðŸŽ¯ Quick Exam-Day Pointers

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

  * **Covered Bonds vs. ABS:** Know the key difference! Covered bonds have **dual recourse** (pool + issuer) and stay **on the balance sheet**. ABS have **single recourse** (pool only) and are **off the balance sheet**.
  * **Internal Credit Enhancements:** You *must* know these.
      * **Subordination:** Creates the "waterfall" where junior tranches take first losses.
      * **Overcollateralization:** More assets than bonds (`$100M` in loans backing `$90M` in bonds).
      * **Excess Spread:** Collateral interest (9%) > Bond coupon (5%). The 4% difference is the first buffer against losses.
  * **Auto vs. Credit Card ABS:**
      * **Auto:** Amortizing pool.
      * **Credit Card:** Non-amortizing pool with a **lockout period** where principal is reinvested.
  * **CDOs:** These are ABS backed by *other debt securities*.
      * **CLO:** Backed by leveraged bank loans.
      * **CBO:** Backed by corporate bonds.
      * **Key Feature:** Actively managed by a **Collateral Manager**.
