## <span style="color: #1565C0;">Reading 6: Simulation Methods</span>

### üéØ Introduction

Welcome, future charterholder! Imagine you're about to play a video game, but instead of fighting dragons, you're trying to predict your portfolio's value in a year. üéÆ You don't know exactly what will happen, but you know the rules of the game (how interest rates and stocks behave). <b>Simulation</b> is like playing that game thousands of times, with the computer making slightly different random moves each time. By looking at all the possible final scores, you can get a much better idea of what your portfolio is likely to be worth and what the worst-case scenarios are. This reading introduces you to the powerful tools that let us "game out" the future of finance.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 1: Why Asset Prices Aren't Normal: The Lognormal Distribution üìà</span>

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.1 Asset Returns vs. Asset Prices</span>

We often assume that asset <b>returns</b> follow a nice, symmetrical bell curve‚Äîa <b>normal distribution</b>. However, asset <b>prices</b> can't follow this pattern. Why? Because a normal distribution has tails that go on forever in both directions, which would imply that an asset's price could become negative. That's impossible! (You can't have a stock worth -‚Çπ100).

The solution is the <b>lognormal distribution</b>.

* It is generated by the function $e^x$, where x is a normally distributed variable.
* It's skewed to the right.
* Crucially, its value can never be less than zero.

This is the perfect fit for asset prices. If we assume that an asset's <b>continuously compounded return</b> is normally distributed, then its future price will follow a lognormal distribution. This is because the future price is the result of compounding:

<div style="background-color: #F5F5F5; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;">

$$P_T = P_0 e^{r_{0,T}}$$

</div>

Where:
  * $P_T$ = Price at future time T
  * $P_0$ = Price today
  * $r_{0,T}$ = The continuously compounded return from today to time T

If $r_{0,T}$ is normally distributed, then $P_T$ must be lognormally distributed.

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">
**üí° CFA Exam Tip ‚úçÔ∏è:** The exam will test why the <b>lognormal distribution</b> is used for asset prices. The answer has two parts:
  * Asset prices cannot be negative, and the lognormal distribution is bounded by zero.
  * It's the natural result of applying a normally distributed continuously compounded return to an initial price.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 2: Creating a Thousand Futures: Monte Carlo Simulation üé∞</span>

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.1 Monte Carlo Simulation Steps</span>

<b>Monte Carlo simulation</b> is a powerful computer-based technique used to model the probability of different outcomes. Think of it as rolling a set of complex, multi-sided dice thousands of times to map out all the possible futures.

Here‚Äôs how it works for valuing a complex asset like a stock option:

  1.  <b>Specify the Model</b>: You start by specifying the probability distributions for the key risk factors. For an option, this would be the distribution of the underlying stock price and interest rates. You'll need to define their parameters (mean, variance, etc.).
  2.  <b>Generate Random Inputs</b>: The computer generates a random value for each risk factor based on the distributions you specified.
  3.  <b>Value the Asset</b>: With one full set of random inputs, you use a pricing model to calculate the value of the security (e.g., the option's value at expiration).
  4.  <b>Repeat, Repeat, Repeat</b>: You repeat steps 2 and 3 hundreds or thousands of times. This creates a distribution of potential asset values.
  5.  <b>Analyze the Results</b>: The mean of all these simulated values is your estimate of the asset's value. You can also analyze the distribution to understand its risk (e.g., the probability of a loss).

**What is it used for?**
  * Valuing complex securities like derivatives.
  * Calculating <b>Value at Risk (VaR)</b> for a portfolio.
  * Simulating a company's future profits or a pension fund's assets and liabilities.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.2 Strengths üëç</span>

The biggest advantage is its flexibility. It allows an analyst to ask "what if?" and test scenarios that have never occurred in history, making it great for stress testing.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.3 Limitations üëé</span>

  * <b>Garbage In, Garbage Out</b>: The simulation is only as good as your assumptions about the probability distributions and the valuation model you use. If your inputs are wrong, your output will be useless.
  * <b>Complexity</b>: It can be complex to set up correctly.
  * <b>Statistical, Not Analytical</b>: It provides a statistical estimate, not a precise analytical solution.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 3: Using What You Have: Bootstrap Resampling ü•æ</span>

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">3.1 Bootstrap Resampling</span>

What if you don't know the proper probability distribution to use for a Monte Carlo simulation? <b>Resampling</b> offers an alternative. Instead of assuming a theoretical distribution, you use your <b>actual historical data</b> as the foundation.

<b>Bootstrap resampling</b> is a popular method. Here's the idea:
  1.  You start with your original sample of historical data (e.g., the last 100 monthly returns of a stock).
  2.  You repeatedly draw smaller samples of the same size from this dataset.
  3.  The key is that you sample <b>with replacement</b>. This means after you pick a data point, you put it back, so it can be picked again in the same sample.

This process allows you to generate many new datasets that are statistically similar to your original one, which you can then use as inputs for a simulation.

The main difference from Monte Carlo is that bootstrap resampling is limited by the distribution of your actual historical data. You can't generate outcomes that are outside the range of what has already happened.

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">
**üí° CFA Exam Tip ‚úçÔ∏è:** The key difference to remember for the exam is the source of the data.
  * <b>Monte Carlo</b> uses <i>assumed theoretical probability distributions</i>.
  * <b>Bootstrap resampling</b> uses the <i>actual historical data, sampled with replacement</i>.

#### <span style="color: #00838F;">Global & Local Context üåç</span>

*Global Example:* Monte Carlo simulation is widely used in global financial markets for pricing complex derivatives and risk management.
*Local Example (India):* Bootstrap resampling is often used by Indian mutual funds to estimate future returns based on historical NAV data.

### üéØ Quick Exam-Day Pointers

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

* <b>Prices are Lognormal, Returns are Normal.</b> ‚úÖ This is a fundamental concept. We use the <b>lognormal distribution</b> for asset prices because prices can't be negative.
* <b>Monte Carlo = "What If?"</b> ‚û°Ô∏è It's a powerful tool for valuing complex assets and stress-testing portfolios because it's based on assumed distributions and can generate outcomes that have never been seen before.
* <b>Bootstrap = "What Was."</b> ‚û°Ô∏è It uses historical data as its engine. This is great when you don't want to make assumptions about a distribution, but it means you're limited to the range of past events.
* <b>All Simulations have a "Garbage In, Garbage Out" Problem.</b> ‚ùå The quality of any simulation's output is entirely dependent on the quality of its input assumptions.
