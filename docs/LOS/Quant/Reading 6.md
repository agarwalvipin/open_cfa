Of course! Here is a detailed summary for Reading 6.

## Reading 6: Simulation Methods

### 🎯 Introduction

Welcome, future charterholder! Imagine you're about to play a video game, but instead of fighting dragons, you're trying to predict your portfolio's value in a year. 🎮 You don't know exactly what will happen, but you know the rules of the game (how interest rates and stocks behave). **Simulation** is like playing that game thousands of times, with the computer making slightly different random moves each time. By looking at all the possible final scores, you can get a much better idea of what your portfolio is likely to be worth and what the worst-case scenarios are. This reading introduces you to the powerful tools that let us "game out" the future of finance.

### Part 1: Why Asset Prices Aren't Normal: The Lognormal Distribution 📈

We often assume that asset *returns* follow a nice, symmetrical bell curve—a **normal distribution**. However, asset *prices* can't follow this pattern. Why? Because a normal distribution has tails that go on forever in both directions, which would imply that an asset's price could become negative. That's impossible! (You can't have a stock worth -₹100).

[cite_start]The solution is the **lognormal distribution**. [cite: 1968]



* [cite_start]It is generated by the function $e^x$, where x is a normally distributed variable. [cite: 1968]
* [cite_start]It's skewed to the right. [cite: 1970]
* [cite_start]Crucially, its value can never be less than zero. [cite: 1970]

This is the perfect fit for asset prices. If we assume that an asset's **continuously compounded return** is normally distributed, then its future price will follow a lognormal distribution. This is because the future price is the result of compounding:

$$P_T = P_0 e^{r_{0,T}}$$

Where:
* [cite_start]$P_T$ = Price at future time T [cite: 1980]
* [cite_start]$P_0$ = Price today [cite: 1981]
* [cite_start]$r_{0,T}$ = The continuously compounded return from today to time T [cite: 1982]

[cite_start]If $r_{0,T}$ is normally distributed, then $P_T$ must be lognormally distributed. [cite: 1986]

> [\!TIP]
> **CFA Exam Tip ✍️:** The exam will test why the lognormal distribution is used for asset prices. The answer has two parts: 1) Asset prices cannot be negative, and the lognormal distribution is bounded by zero. 2) It's the natural result of applying a normally distributed continuously compounded return to an initial price.

### Part 2: Creating a Thousand Futures: Monte Carlo Simulation 🎰

[cite_start]**Monte Carlo simulation** is a powerful computer-based technique used to model the probability of different outcomes. [cite: 1991] Think of it as rolling a set of complex, multi-sided dice thousands of times to map out all the possible futures.

Here’s how it works for valuing a complex asset like a stock option:

1.  **Specify the Model**: You start by specifying the probability distributions for the key risk factors. For an option, this would be the distribution of the underlying stock price and interest rates. [cite_start]You'll need to define their parameters (mean, variance, etc.). [cite: 1999, 2000]
2.  [cite_start]**Generate Random Inputs**: The computer generates a random value for each risk factor based on the distributions you specified. [cite: 2001]
3.  [cite_start]**Value the Asset**: With one full set of random inputs, you use a pricing model to calculate the value of the security (e.g., the option's value at expiration). [cite: 2002]
4.  **Repeat, Repeat, Repeat**: You repeat steps 2 and 3 hundreds or thousands of times. [cite_start]This creates a distribution of potential asset values. [cite: 2003]
5.  **Analyze the Results**: The mean of all these simulated values is your estimate of the asset's value. [cite_start]You can also analyze the distribution to understand its risk (e.g., the probability of a loss). [cite: 2003]

**What is it used for?**
* [cite_start]Valuing complex securities like derivatives. [cite: 2005]
* [cite_start]Calculating **Value at Risk (VaR)** for a portfolio. [cite: 2007]
* [cite_start]Simulating a company's future profits or a pension fund's assets and liabilities. [cite: 2006, 2008]

#### **Strengths 👍**

The biggest advantage is its flexibility. [cite_start]It allows an analyst to ask "what if?" and test scenarios that have never occurred in history, making it great for stress testing. [cite: 2010]

#### **Limitations 👎**

* **Garbage In, Garbage Out**: The simulation is only as good as your assumptions about the probability distributions and the valuation model you use. [cite_start]If your inputs are wrong, your output will be useless. [cite: 2012]
* [cite_start]**Complexity**: It can be complex to set up correctly. [cite: 2012]
* [cite_start]**Statistical, Not Analytical**: It provides a statistical estimate, not a precise analytical solution. [cite: 2013]

### Part 3: Using What You Have: Bootstrap Resampling 🥾

What if you don't know the proper probability distribution to use for a Monte Carlo simulation? **Resampling** offers an alternative. [cite_start]Instead of assuming a theoretical distribution, you use your *actual historical data* as the foundation. [cite: 2015]

**Bootstrap resampling** is a popular method. Here's the idea:
1.  You start with your original sample of historical data (e.g., the last 100 monthly returns of a stock).
2.  You repeatedly draw smaller samples of the same size from this dataset.
3.  The key is that you sample **with replacement**. [cite_start]This means after you pick a data point, you put it back, so it can be picked again in the same sample. [cite: 2020]

[cite_start]This process allows you to generate many new datasets that are statistically similar to your original one, which you can then use as inputs for a simulation. [cite: 2022]

The main difference from Monte Carlo is that bootstrap resampling is limited by the distribution of your actual historical data. [cite_start]You can't generate outcomes that are outside the range of what has already happened. [cite: 2024]

> [\!TIP]
> **CFA Exam Tip ✍️:** The key difference to remember for the exam is the source of the data. **Monte Carlo** uses *assumed theoretical probability distributions*. **Bootstrap resampling** uses the *actual historical data, sampled with replacement*.

>
> * **Prices are Lognormal, Returns are Normal.** This is a fundamental concept. We use the **lognormal distribution** for asset prices because prices can't be negative.
> * **Monte Carlo = "What If?"** It's a powerful tool for valuing complex assets and stress-testing portfolios because it's based on assumed distributions and can generate outcomes that have never been seen before.
> * **Bootstrap = "What Was."** It uses historical data as its engine. This is great when you don't want to make assumptions about a distribution, but it means you're limited to the range of past events.
> * **All Simulations have a "Garbage In, Garbage Out" Problem.** The quality of any simulation's output is entirely dependent on the quality of its input assumptions.
