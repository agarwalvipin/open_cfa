## <span style="color: #1565C0;">Reading 10: Simple Linear Regression</span>

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">üéØ Introduction</span>

Welcome, future charterholder! Imagine you're trying to predict how much ice cream a shop will sell. üç¶ You have a hunch that sales are related to the daily temperature. <b>Simple Linear Regression</b> is the statistical tool that lets you formally model this relationship. It draws the "best fit" line through your data to answer two key questions: 1) <i>How strong</i> is the relationship between temperature (the <b>independent variable</b>) and ice cream sales (the <b>dependent variable</b>)? and 2) If the forecast is 30¬∞C tomorrow, <i>how many</i> ice creams should we expect to sell? This reading is your guide to drawing that line, testing if it's meaningful, and using it to make powerful predictions.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 1: Building the Model: The Line of Best Fit üìà</span>

<b>Simple linear regression</b> aims to explain the variation in one variable (the <b>dependent variable, Y</b>) using the variation in a single other variable (the <b>independent variable, X</b>).

The model is described by a simple equation:

<div style="background-color: #F5F5F5; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;">

$$Y_i = b_0 + b_1X_i + \epsilon_i$$

</div>

Where:
* $Y_i$ = The actual value of the <b>dependent variable</b> for observation `i`.
* $X_i$ = The value of the <b>independent variable</b> for observation `i`.
* $b_0$ = The <b>intercept</b>, the value of Y when X is zero.
* $b_1$ = The <b>slope coefficient</b>, the change in Y for a one-unit change in X.
* $\epsilon_i$ = The <b>error term</b> or <b>residual</b>, the part of Y that the model can't explain.

To find the "best fit" line, we use the <b>least squares criterion</b>. This method chooses the intercept ($\hat{b}_0$) and slope ($\hat{b}_1$) that <b>minimize the sum of the squared errors (SSE)</b>. This is why it's often called <b>Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)</b>.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.1 Interpreting the Coefficients</span>

* <b>Intercept ($\hat{b}_0$)</b>: This is the predicted value of Y when X is 0.
* <b>Slope ($\hat{b}_1$)</b>: This is the heart of the model. It tells you the predicted change in Y for a one-unit change in X.

#### <span style="color: #00838F;">1.2 Global & Local Context üåç</span>

Let's run a regression of the excess returns of a specific stock (e.g., Tata Motors in India) against the excess returns of the market (e.g., the Nifty 50 index). The resulting equation might be:

<div style="background-color: #F5F5F5; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;">

Tata Motors Return = -0.023 + 0.64(Nifty 50 Return)

</div>

* <b>Interpretation of Intercept ($\hat{b}_0 = -2.3\%$ or -0.023)</b>: When the market's excess return is zero, the model predicts that Tata Motors' excess return will be -2.3%.
* <b>Interpretation of Slope ($\hat{b}_1 = 0.64$)</b>: For every 1% increase in the Nifty 50's excess return, the model predicts a 0.64% increase in Tata Motors' excess return. In finance, this slope coefficient is the stock's <b>beta</b>!

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.3 The Ground Rules: Assumptions of Linear Regression</span>

For our model to be reliable, a few assumptions must hold:
  1.  <b>Linear Relationship</b>: The relationship between X and Y must be linear.
  2.  <b>Homoskedasticity</b>: The variance of the residuals must be constant for all values of X. (The opposite is <b>heteroskedasticity</b>, where the error variance changes).
  3.  <b>Independence</b>: The residuals must be independent of each other (no autocorrelation).
  4.  <b>Normality</b>: The residuals should be normally distributed.

You can check these assumptions by looking at <b>residual plots</b>. If you see a clear pattern (like a curve or a funnel shape), one of the assumptions is likely violated.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 2: Is the Model Any Good? Measuring Fit and Significance üßê</span>

Once we have our model, we need to know if it's actually useful. We do this using <b>Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)</b> and a few key statistics.

ANOVA breaks down the total variation in the dependent variable (Y) into two parts: the part explained by our model and the part that's left unexplained.

* <b>Total Sum of Squares (SST)</b>: The total variation of the Y-values from their mean.
* <b>Regression Sum of Squares (SSR)</b>: The variation in Y that is <i>explained</i> by our model.
* <b>Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)</b>: The variation in Y that is <i>unexplained</i> by our model (the residuals).

The fundamental relationship is: <b>SST = SSR + SSE</b>.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.1 Measures of Goodness-of-Fit</span>

* <b>Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$)</b>: This is the most popular measure of fit. It's the percentage of the total variation in Y that is explained by X.

  <div style="background-color: #F5F5F5; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;">
  
  $$R^2 = \frac{SSR}{SST}$$
  
  </div>
  
  An $R^2$ of 0.60 means that 60% of the movement in the dependent variable can be explained by the movement in the independent variable. For a simple linear regression, this is just the correlation coefficient squared ($r^2$).

* <b>Standard Error of Estimate (SEE)</b>: This is the standard deviation of the residuals. A smaller SEE means the model's predictions are more accurate.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.2 Testing for Significance</span>

Does our independent variable actually have a significant relationship with the dependent variable? We test this with the null hypothesis that the slope coefficient is zero ($H_0: b_1 = 0$).

* <b>t-Test</b>: This tests the significance of an individual coefficient. We calculate a t-statistic:

  <div style="background-color: #F5F5F5; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;">
  
  $$t = \frac{\text{Estimated Coefficient}}{\text{Standard Error of Coefficient}}$$
  
  </div>
  
  If this <b>t-stat</b> is larger than the critical t-value (from a t-table with <b>n-2 degrees of freedom</b>), we can reject the null and conclude the coefficient is statistically significant.

* <b>F-Test</b>: This tests the overall significance of the <i>entire model</i>. For a simple linear regression with only one independent variable, the F-test gives the exact same conclusion as the t-test for the slope.

  <div style="background-color: #F5F5F5; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;">
  
  $$F = \frac{MSR}{MSE}$$
  
  </div>
  (where MSR is Mean Square Regression and MSE is Mean Square Error from the ANOVA table).

<div style="background-color: #E3F2FD; border-left: 5px solid #1976D2; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

üí° CFA Exam Tip ‚úçÔ∏è:You must be able to read an ANOVA table. Know that <b>$R^2 = SSR / SST$</b> and <b>$SEE = \sqrt{MSE}$</b>. Also, remember that for simple linear regression, the F-statistic is just the square of the slope's t-statistic (<b>$F = t^2$</b>).

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 3: Making Predictions and Exploring New Forms üîÆ</span>

The whole point of building a model is to use it!

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">3.1 Predicting Y and Creating Intervals</span>

Given a forecast for our independent variable ($X_p$), we can easily calculate the predicted value for Y:

<div style="background-color: #F5F5F5; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;">
$$\hat{Y} = \hat{b}_0 + \hat{b}_1 X_p$$
</div>

But this is just a point estimate. It's more useful to create a <b>prediction interval</b>, which gives a range that we're confident the actual future Y value will fall into.

<div style="background-color: #F5F5F5; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;">
$$\text{Prediction Interval} = \hat{Y} \pm (t_c \times s_f)$$
</div>

Where:
  * $t_c$ = The critical t-value (with n-2 df).
  * $s_f$ = The standard error of the forecast.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">3.2 Different Functional Forms</span>

What if the relationship isn't a straight line? We can often transform the variables to make it linear. The most common transformation is using the natural logarithm (ln).

* <b>Log-Lin Model ($\ln(Y)$ vs. $X$)</b>: The slope coefficient represents the <i>relative</i> change in Y for an <i>absolute</i> change in X.
* <b>Lin-Log Model ($Y$ vs. $\ln(X)$)</b>: The slope represents the <i>absolute</i> change in Y for a <i>relative</i> change in X.
* <b>Log-Log Model ($\ln(Y)$ vs. $\ln(X)$)</b>: The slope represents the <i>relative</i> change in Y for a <i>relative</i> change in X. This slope is an <b>elasticity</b>.

<div style="background-color: #E3F2FD; border-left: 5px solid #1976D2; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

üí° CFA Exam Tip ‚úçÔ∏è:The log-log model is important. If you see a regression where both Y and X have been transformed with natural logs, the slope coefficient ($\hat{b}_1$) can be directly interpreted as an elasticity. For example, if $\ln(\text{Demand}) = 2.5 - 1.5\ln(\text{Price})$, the price elasticity of demand is -1.5.

### üéØ Quick Exam-Day Pointers

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

* <b>Interpret the Slope!</b> The slope ($\hat{b}_1$) is the most important part of the model. It's the predicted change in Y for a one-unit change in X.
* <b>$R^2$ is Explanatory Power.</b> It tells you what percentage of the dependent variable's movement is explained by the independent variable.
* <b>Check for Significance.</b> Use the <b>t-statistic</b> to check if the slope is significantly different from zero. A high t-stat (generally > 2 for a 5% significance test) means the variable is a significant predictor.
* <b>Assumptions Matter.</b> Be able to spot violations like <b>heteroskedasticity</b> (funnel shape in residual plot) from a description.
* <b>Log-Log = Elasticity.</b> If both variables are in log form, the slope coefficient is the elasticity.
