## Reading 92: Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS) - Capstone Review 🚀

### **🎯 Introduction: The Universal Seal of Trust**

We've journeyed through the detailed rules of GIPS, from its core principles to its advertising guidelines. This final summary serves as your ultimate "cheat sheet." Think of GIPS as the financial world's equivalent of an ISO 9001 certification. It is a voluntary "seal of approval" that tells clients a firm has committed to the highest ethical standards for calculating and presenting its investment performance. It ensures that when you compare performance reports from two GIPS-compliant firms, you are truly comparing apples to apples. 🍎🍏

### **Part 1: The "Why" and "Who" of GIPS 🤔**

#### **Why does GIPS exist?**
The primary goal is to provide a standardized, ethical framework that ensures **fair representation and full disclosure** of investment performance. This fosters:
* **Comparability:** Allowing clients to make meaningful comparisons among investment managers.
* **Confidence:** Giving clients trust in the performance numbers they see.
* **Fair Competition:** Forcing firms to compete on the merits of their performance, not on clever marketing.

#### **Who can comply?**
Initially designed for investment management firms, the **GIPS 2020 update** expanded its scope.
* **Investment Firms:** The traditional audience, like mutual fund companies (e.g., Franklin Templeton) or wealth managers.
* **Asset Owners:** A major addition. This includes pension plans (like EPFO in India or CalPERS in the US), endowments, and sovereign wealth funds that manage their own assets.

### **Part 2: The Core Pillars of GIPS Compliance 🏛️**

These are the non-negotiable principles that form the foundation of GIPS.

1.  **Firm-Wide Compliance:** GIPS is an "all-or-nothing" standard. A firm must define itself as a distinct business entity and apply the standards to its entire operation. It cannot pick and choose to apply GIPS only to its best-performing strategies.
2.  **Composites are Mandatory:** This is the heart of GIPS. A **composite** is an aggregation of all actual, fee-paying, discretionary portfolios managed under a similar strategy. This prevents firms from cherry-picking their best accounts to show to prospective clients.
3.  **Calculation Integrity:** GIPS mandates specific methodologies to ensure consistency. The two most important are:
    * **Fair Value:** All assets in a portfolio must be valued at their current fair market value.
    * **Time-Weighted Return (TWRR):** Performance must be calculated using a TWRR methodology to eliminate the distorting effects of client cash flows.
4.  **A Consistent Track Record:** Firms must present a minimum of **five years** of GIPS-compliant performance (or since the firm's/composite's inception if shorter). After the initial five years, the firm must add one additional year of performance annually, up to a minimum of **ten years**.

> **CFA Exam Tip ✍️:** Remember the distinction between what's *required* and what's *recommended*. **Verification** by a third party is strongly recommended to add credibility, but it is **not required** for a firm to claim GIPS compliance.

### **Part 3: Presenting and Advertising GIPS 📢**

How a firm communicates its compliance is strictly regulated.

* **Full Presentation:** A complete GIPS-compliant presentation contains detailed information, disclosures, and the 5-10 year performance track record. It must be provided to any prospective client.
* **Advertising:** When a firm mentions GIPS in an ad, it must follow the GIPS Advertising Guidelines. This requires:
    * The standardized compliance statement: "[Firm Name] claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®)."
    * A description of the firm and the composite being shown.
    * **1, 3, and 5-year annualized returns** for both the composite and its benchmark.

### **🧪 Formula Summary**

The GIPS standards are principles-based. The only key formula to understand conceptually is the **Time-Weighted Rate of Return (TWRR)**, which geometrically links sub-period returns to neutralize the impact of cash flows.

* $$TWRR = [(1+R_1) \times (1+R_2) \times ... \times (1+R_n)] - 1$$

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### 🎯 Quick Exam-Day Pointers
> * **Voluntary but Firm-Wide:** GIPS is not a law, but if you claim compliance, you must apply it everywhere within your defined firm.
> * **No Cherry-Picking:** Composites must include *all* actual, fee-paying, discretionary portfolios in a strategy. This is a foundational rule.
> * **"Claim Compliance," Don't "Get Certified":** A firm "claims compliance with GIPS." It is never "GIPS certified" or "approved by GIPS."
> * **5 Years Minimum, 10 Years Goal:** Remember the 5/10 year rule for performance history in a full presentation.
> * **GIPS 2020 = More Flexibility:** The key theme of the 2020 update was expanding the scope to asset owners and providing more practical reporting options for pooled funds.
