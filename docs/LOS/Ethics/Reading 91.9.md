## Reading 90: Guidance for Standard VII - Responsibilities as a CFA Member/Candidate 🚀

### **🎯 Introduction: Wearing the Jersey**

Think of the CFA designation as the jersey of a prestigious global sports team, like the New York Yankees or the Indian Cricket Team. 🏏 When you wear that jersey—either as a full team member (a charterholder) or a promising rookie (a candidate)—your actions reflect on the entire team. Standard VII provides the rules for how to wear that jersey with honor. It’s about protecting the reputation of the CFA designation itself, ensuring that its value is never diluted by misconduct or improper advertising. This is your duty to the global community of past, present, and future CFA charterholders.

### **Part 1: Standard VII(A) - Conduct as Participants in CFA Institute Programs 🤔**

This standard is about maintaining the integrity of the CFA Program. In short: don't cheat and don't compromise the exam process.

* **Core Concept:** You must not engage in any conduct that compromises the reputation or integrity of CFA Institute or the CFA designation, or the integrity, validity, or security of the CFA examinations.
* **What this includes:**
    * **Cheating on the Exam:** This is the most obvious violation. It includes using unauthorized materials, copying from another candidate, or trying to solicit help during the exam.
    * **Disclosing Exam Content:** You cannot share any specific details about exam questions after the exam. This includes posting on forums like Reddit or discussing questions with your study group. General comments like "the afternoon session was tough" are okay, but specifics are forbidden.
    * **Disregarding Rules:** Not following the instructions of the exam proctors.
    * **Misrepresenting Information:** Providing false information on your enrollment application or Professional Conduct Statement.
* **Example 🧮:** A candidate in Mumbai finishes the Level I exam. That evening, he goes onto an online forum and posts, "That question about the DuPont formula for Company XYZ was brutal! What did everyone get?" This is a clear violation of Standard VII(A). By disclosing specific question content, he is compromising the security and integrity of the examination.

> [!TIP]
> **CFA Exam Tip ✍️:** The most common exam trap for Standard VII(A) involves sharing confidential exam information. Remember, the prohibition is absolute. You cannot share questions or content with anyone, including your tutors, friends, or online study groups.

### **Part 2: Standard VII(B) - Reference to CFA Institute, the CFA Designation, and the CFA Program 🏅**

This standard governs how you can refer to your status as a charterholder or a candidate. You must be accurate and not exaggerate your standing.

* **Core Concept:** When referring to CFA Institute, membership, the designation, or the program, you must not misrepresent or exaggerate the meaning or implications of your status.
* **The Golden Rules for Candidates:**
    * You **CAN** state that you are a candidate in the CFA Program. You can also mention the level you are currently registered for or have passed (e.g., "I have passed all three levels of the CFA Program and will be eligible for the charter upon completion of the work experience requirement.").
    * You **CANNOT** imply that you have a partial designation. There is no such thing as a "Level II CFA." You are a candidate until you are a charterholder.
    * You **CANNOT** mention your candidacy in a way that implies you have superior skills or knowledge (e.g., "As a Level III candidate, my stock picks are more advanced.").
* **The Golden Rules for Charterholders:**
    * You **CAN** use the "CFA" or "Chartered Financial Analyst" marks after your name (e.g., "Rohan Sharma, CFA").
    * You **CANNOT** alter the marks or use them as nouns.
        * **Correct:** "I am a CFA charterholder."
        * **Incorrect:** "I am a CFA." or "My services are the best because I'm a Chartered Financial Analyst."
* **Tabs: Do's and Don'ts**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### 🎯 Quick Exam-Day Pointers
> * **VII(A) Exam Integrity:** Never share confidential exam information, period. This is a cardinal sin in the CFA universe.
> * **VII(B) No Partial Designation:** You are either a **candidate** or a **charterholder**. There is no in-between status like "Level II CFA."
> * **CFA is an Adjective, Not a Noun:** A person is a "CFA charterholder," they are not "a CFA." The marks "CFA®" are used after a name, like a title.
> * **Don't Exaggerate:** Being a candidate or charterholder is a mark of distinction, but you cannot use it to promise superior performance or guarantee investment results.
