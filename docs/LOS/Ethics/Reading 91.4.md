### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 4: What's New in GIPS 2020? Key Changes & Provisions (LOS 91.4)</span>

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">4.1 Introduction: GIPS Gets an Upgrade!</span>

Think of the original **GIPS standards** as the first version of a popular smartphone app. It was great, did its job well, but over time, the industry evolved. New investment strategies emerged (like asset owners managing their own money and firms with complex structures), and technology changed. The **GIPS 2020 standards** are like the latest software update üì≤‚Äîthey keep the core features that everyone loves but add new capabilities to make the app more powerful, flexible, and relevant for today's financial world. This update ensures that the GIPS standards remain the global **gold standard** for performance reporting.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">4.2 Key Changes & Provisions</span>

The **GIPS 2020 standards** introduced several important changes to broaden their applicability and improve their utility. The goal was to move beyond just traditional asset managers and embrace a wider range of investment firms.

There are three primary GIPS standards, each tailored to a different type of firm:

* **GIPS Standards for Firms:** The main standard for traditional investment management firms.
* **GIPS Standards for Asset Owners:** A tailored version for entities like pension plans, endowments, and sovereign wealth funds that manage their own assets.
* **GIPS Standards for Verifiers:** The rules and procedures for third-party firms that perform GIPS verification.

#### <span style="color: #E65100;">4.2.1 Tailored Provisions for Pooled Funds ÌéÄÎìú</span>

GIPS 2020 makes it easier for managers of **pooled funds** (like mutual funds or ETFs) to present performance.

* **Before:** A manager had to create a composite and present its performance.
* **Now (GIPS 2020):** Firms can present the performance of the pooled fund *itself* directly to prospective investors of that fund, instead of creating a composite report. This is more straightforward and intuitive. They can simply show the fund's own track record.
* **üåç Global & Local Context:**  
  <span style="color: #00838F;">A firm like HDFC Mutual Fund can now present the historical performance of its "HDFC Top 100 Fund" directly to a potential investor in that fund, which is simpler than creating a broad "Large-Cap Equity" composite report for that purpose.</span>

#### <span style="color: #E65100;">4.2.2 Flexibility for Carve-Outs with Allocated Cash üíµ</span>

Sometimes a firm manages a large, multi-asset portfolio (e.g., a balanced fund) but wants to show the track record of just one portion of that strategy (e.g., just the equity sleeve). This smaller portion is called a **carve-out**.

* **The Problem:** How do you account for the cash held in the overall portfolio when showing the performance of just the equity part?
* **GIPS 2020 Solution:** The standards now provide two options for including a carve-out in a composite:
  * **Include Allocated Cash:** The carve-out must be managed separately with its own cash allocation.
  * **Use a Stated Allocation:** If cash is not separately allocated, the firm must disclose the model used to allocate a theoretical cash balance to the carve-out's performance. This adds flexibility while maintaining transparency.

#### <span style="color: #E65100;">4.2.3 Expanded Provisions for Asset Owners üèõÔ∏è</span>

This is one of the biggest changes. **Asset owners**, like the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) in India or the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) in the US, often manage money internally.

* **GIPS 2020 for Asset Owners:** Provides specific guidance for them to report their performance. They can choose the scope of their reporting‚Äîit can be their total fund, a specific asset class (like their global equity portfolio), or even a group of external managers they've hired.
* **Key Benefit:** This allows stakeholders (like pensioners or government bodies) to evaluate the performance of the asset owner with the same rigor and transparency expected of external managers.

-----

#### <span style="color: #00838F;">4.3 Global & Local Context üåç</span>

Examples:
* **Global:** CalPERS in the US can now report performance for its total fund or specific asset classes.
* **Local (India):** EPFO can present its own performance to stakeholders, increasing transparency.

### üéØ Quick Exam-Day Pointers

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">
* **GIPS 2020 = Flexibility + Broader Scope:**  
  ‚Üí The main goal of the update was to make the standards more practical for a wider range of firms, especially asset owners and those with pooled funds. ‚úÖ
* **Asset Owners are Now Covered:**  
  ‚Üí GIPS is no longer just for firms managing money for others. Pension funds, endowments, and other asset owners can now claim compliance for their total fund or parts of it. ‚úÖ
* **Pooled Funds Get a Shortcut:**  
  ‚Üí Firms can now show a pooled fund's own performance directly to its prospective investors, bypassing the need for a composite presentation in that context. ‚¨áÔ∏è
* **Carve-Outs Need Cash:**  
  ‚Üí When showing performance for a piece of a larger portfolio (a carve-out), you must account for cash, either by actually allocating it or by using and disclosing a model to simulate it. ‚ùå if not disclosed.
