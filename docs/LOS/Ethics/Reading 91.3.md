### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 3: Advertising Your GIPS Compliance Correctly (LOS 91.c)</span>

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">3.1 Introduction: The GIPS Seal of Approval</span>

Imagine a food product at the supermarket proudly displaying a "<strong>Certified Organic</strong>" logo. üåø That seal tells you the product met a specific, trustworthy standard. In the same way, the <strong>GIPS standards</strong> allow compliant firms to advertise their commitment to ethical performance reporting. However, to prevent this "seal of approval" from being misused, GIPS has very specific rules about what firms can and cannot say in their advertisements. This section covers the essential guidelines for making a proper GIPS compliance claim.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">3.2 GIPS Advertising Guidelines</span>

Once a firm has gone through the hard work of becoming <strong>GIPS compliant</strong>, it's natural to want to tell the world. The <strong>GIPS Advertising Guidelines</strong> are a specific subset of the standards that govern how a firm can reference its compliance status in marketing materials (e.g., brochures, print ads, website banners).

The goal is to provide a brief, standardized statement that gives clients and prospects confidence without being misleading.

##### <span style="color: #E65100;">3.2.1 Required Elements in a GIPS-Compliant Advertisement</span>

Any advertisement that references a claim of <strong>GIPS compliance</strong> <span style="color: #F57C00;">‚úÖ must include</span> the following four key elements:

* <strong>The Firm's Definition üè¢:</strong>  
  A precise description of the investment firm that is claiming compliance.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;*Example:* "ABC Asset Management is an independent investment adviser founded in 2010, specializing in Indian equities."

* <strong>The GIPS Compliance Statement ‚úÖ:</strong>  
  A specific, standardized sentence that states the firm's compliance.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;*Required wording:* "[Insert name of firm] claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS¬Æ)."

* <strong>Composite Description üß∫:</strong>  
  A brief description of the composite strategy being advertised. This should give a clear picture of the investment mandate.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;*Example:* "The ABC Large-Cap Value Composite includes all fee-paying, discretionary portfolios managed with a value-oriented strategy focused on the top 100 publicly traded companies in India by market capitalization."

* <strong>Performance and Reporting Information üìà:</strong>  
  The advertisement must show:  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;* The composite's total return for one, three, and five-year annualized periods (or periods since inception if shorter).  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;* The benchmark's corresponding total return for the same periods.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;* The number of portfolios in the composite.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;* The amount of assets in the composite.

<strong>üí° CFA Exam Tip ‚úçÔ∏è:</strong> The exam frequently asks what is <strong>required</strong> versus what is <strong>recommended</strong> in a GIPS context. For advertising, you <strong>must memorize</strong> the required elements.  
<span style="color: #F57C00;">‚ùå A firm cannot show only its one-year return.</span>  
<span style="color: #1976D2;">‚úÖ One, three, and five-year returns are required if the track record exists.</span>

### üéØ Quick Exam-Day Pointers

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">
* <strong>Advertising has specific rules:</strong>  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;‚Üí Not all GIPS provisions apply to advertising, only the GIPS Advertising Guidelines.
* <strong>The Compliance Statement is NON-NEGOTIABLE:</strong>  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;‚úÖ Firms must use the exact wording: "[Firm Name] claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS¬Æ)."  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;‚ùå They cannot say they are "GIPS certified" or "approved by GIPS."
* <strong>Remember the Time Periods:</strong>  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;‚úÖ Advertisements must show 1, 3, and 5-year annualized returns for both the composite and its benchmark.
* <strong>Verification is NOT Required:</strong>  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;‚¨áÔ∏è While firms are encouraged to be verified, they do not have to be verified to claim GIPS compliance in an advertisement.
* <strong>Offer More Info:</strong>  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;‚úÖ A compliant ad must state that a full GIPS-compliant presentation is available upon request. This ensures prospective clients can get all the details if they want them.
