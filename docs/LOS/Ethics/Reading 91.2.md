## <span style="color: #1565C0;">Reading 91: Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS) 🚀</span>

### 🎯 Introduction: The GIPS Rulebook

Now that we understand *why* GIPS exists, let's look at the "how." The GIPS standards are organized into nine sections, like chapters in a rulebook. Each chapter governs a specific part of the performance presentation process, from gathering the initial data to showing the final report to a client. Think of it as a recipe for a cake 🎂: you need to get the right ingredients (**Input Data**), mix them correctly (**Calculation Methodology**), and decorate it honestly (**Presentation**). Following each step ensures the final product is **transparent** and **trustworthy**.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 1: The Nine Major Sections of the GIPS Standards 📖</span>

Here’s a breakdown of the essential "chapters" in the GIPS rulebook.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.1 Fundamentals of Compliance ✅</span>

This section sets the foundation. It emphasizes that compliance with GIPS is a **firm-wide** endeavor. The firm must be defined as a distinct business entity (e.g., "Kotak Asset Management"). It can't just pick and choose which parts of its business will follow the rules. It also states that firms must provide a compliant presentation to *all* prospective clients.

* **Core Principle:** ✅ You're either all in or all out. **No partial compliance** is allowed.
* **Global & Local Context 🌍:** A global firm like BlackRock must define what "the firm" is for GIPS purposes. It could be the entire global entity or a specific subsidiary, like "BlackRock Asset Management North America." Once defined, that entire entity must comply.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.2 Input Data 📥</span>

This is all about the quality of your ingredients. Performance calculations are only as good as the data they are based on. This section requires firms to use **fair and consistent input data**. For example, portfolio valuations should be based on **fair value**, not just historical cost.

* **Core Principle:** ❌ Garbage in, garbage out. ✅ Use high-quality, consistent data for all calculations.
* **Example 🧮:** When calculating the value of its holdings in Reliance Industries, a firm must use the market price from a reliable source (like the NSE closing price) and apply this method consistently across all portfolios.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.3 Calculation Methodology 🧮</span>

This chapter provides the specific formulas and methods for calculating returns. It's the technical core of GIPS. Key requirements include:
  * **Time-Weighted Returns:** Returns must be calculated using a **time-weighted rate of return** methodology, which removes the distorting effects of cash flows.
  * **Accrual Accounting:** Portfolios must be accounted for using **accrual basis** accounting (e.g., recognizing dividend income on the ex-dividend date, not the payment date).
  * **Valuation Frequency:** Portfolios must be valued at least monthly.

**💡 CFA Exam Tip ✍️:** The exam loves to test the requirement for **time-weighted returns**. Remember this is crucial for comparability, as it reflects the manager's skill, not the timing of client contributions or withdrawals.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.4 Composite Construction 🧺</span>

We've touched on this before, and it's a cornerstone of GIPS. A firm must create **composites** for each of its distinct investment strategies. These composites must include *all* actual, fee-paying, discretionary portfolios for that strategy.

* **Core Principle:** ❌ No cherry-picking. ✅ All portfolios in a given strategy must be included to prevent firms from only showing off their winners.
* **Example 🧮:** If an Axis Mutual Fund manager has 50 accounts in their "Mid-Cap Momentum" strategy, all 50 must be included in the Mid-Cap Momentum composite. They cannot exclude the three accounts that underperformed last year.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.5 Disclosure 📄</span>

This section is all about **transparency**. Firms must disclose key information that helps clients understand the performance presentation. Think of it as the "nutrition label" on the performance report. Disclosures include things like the firm's definition, fee schedules, and currency used.

* **Core Principle:** ✅ Tell the whole story. Give clients the context they need to interpret the numbers correctly.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.6 Presentation and Reporting 📊</span>

This governs what the final report looks like. GIPS requires that presentations show at least five years of GIPS-compliant performance (or since inception if the firm/composite is younger). After presenting five years, the firm must add one additional year of performance each year, up to a minimum of ten years.

* **Core Principle:** ✅ Show a long-term, consistent track record.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.7 Real Estate 🏢</span>

This section provides specific rules for **real estate investments**, which have unique valuation challenges. It requires certain valuation methodologies and the use of external appraisers.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.8 Private Equity 💼</span>

Similar to real estate, private equity requires specific guidance. This section addresses the unique characteristics of PE investments, such as committed capital, vintage year, and specific valuation methods. It requires the calculation of metrics like the **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)** since inception.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.9 Wrap Fee / Separately Managed Account (SMA) Portfolios 🎁</span>

This provides specific rules for "wrap fee" accounts, where a single fee covers investment management, brokerage, and administrative costs.

### 🧪 Formula Summary

<div style="background-color: #F5F5F5; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;">

**Time-Weighted Rate of Return (TWRR):**
This method breaks the overall period into sub-periods based on the timing of external cash flows and calculates a geometric mean of the returns for each sub-period.

$$TWRR = [(1+R_1) \times (1+R_2) \times ... \times (1+R_n)] - 1$$

Where $R_n$ is the return for sub-period *n*.

### 🎯 Quick Exam-Day Pointers

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

* **Nine Sections, One Goal:** ✅ All nine sections work together to ensure fair, consistent, and transparent performance reporting.
* **Definition of the Firm is Crucial:** Compliance starts with properly defining the firm. This definition determines the scope of GIPS compliance.
* **Input Data Must Be Fair Value:** Always use fair, market-based values for portfolio holdings.
* **Time-Weighted Return is King:** For GIPS, the required calculation methodology is TWRR to eliminate the impact of cash flows.
* **5 to 10 Year Rule:** Remember the presentation requirement: *at least* five years of performance, building up to *at least* ten years.
