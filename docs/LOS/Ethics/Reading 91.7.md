### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 1: Guidance for Standard V - Investment Analysis, Recommendations, and Actions (LOS 91.7)</span>

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.1 üéØ Introduction: The Analyst's Craft</span>

Think of yourself as a master chef in a world-class kitchen. üßë‚Äçüç≥ Your clients are the diners, and your investment recommendations are the dishes you serve. **Standard V** is your recipe for excellence. It ensures that every dish you create is made with the finest ingredients (**thorough research**), prepared with skill and care (**diligent analysis**), and presented honestly on the menu (**clear communication**). It also requires you to keep a detailed log of your recipes (**record retention**). This standard is the foundation of your professional credibility and ensures your clients can trust what you put on their plate.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 2: Standard V(A) - Diligence and Reasonable Basis (LOS 91.7.a)</span>

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.1 Core Concept</span>
* You must have a **reasonable and adequate basis** for any investment recommendation you make. The level of diligence required will depend on the product or service you are offering.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.2 What does "reasonable basis" mean?</span>
* **Research:**  
  * Reviewing financial statements, industry reports, and economic data.
* **Quantitative Analysis:**  
  * Using appropriate financial models and valuation techniques.
* **Expert Consultation:**  
  * Considering the opinions of other analysts or specialists when necessary.

* **Using Third-Party Research üì∞:**  
  * You can rely on research from others (like a report from another brokerage), but you must make a reasonable effort to ensure that the research is sound. Simply using a report because it supports your view without vetting its quality is a ‚ùå violation.

#### <span style="color: #00838F;">2.3 Global & Local Context üåç</span>
* An analyst at a US firm like Goldman Sachs cannot simply issue a "buy" rating on a new, speculative tech stock just because it's popular. They must build detailed financial models, analyze the competitive landscape, and document their assumptions.
* Similarly, an analyst in India covering Tata Motors must go beyond just reading the annual report; they should analyze auto sales data, commodity prices (like steel), and the company's position relative to competitors like Mahindra & Mahindra.

**üí° CFA Exam Tip ‚úçÔ∏è:** Questions on V(A) often test the use of third-party or quantitative research. Remember, you are responsible for the recommendations you make, even if they are based on someone else's model or report. You must understand the model's limitations and assumptions before relying on it.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 3: Standard V(B) - Communication with Clients (LOS 91.7.b)</span>

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">3.1 Core Concept</span>
* You must distinguish between **fact and opinion**. You also need to communicate the basic principles of your investment process and disclose any significant limitations or risks.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">3.2 Fact vs. Opinion</span>
* **Fact:**  
  * "Apple Inc.'s revenue in the last fiscal year was \$394 billion."
* **Opinion:**  
  * "I believe Apple Inc. is an excellent investment that is likely to outperform the market."

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">3.3 Disclose Limitations</span>
* If your valuation of a company is highly sensitive to one specific assumption (e.g., the price of oil), you must inform the client of this risk. If your model doesn't work well in certain market conditions, disclose that.

#### <span style="color: #E65100;">3.4 Example üßÆ</span>
* A wealth manager recommends a complex structured product to a client. Under Standard V(B), they must clearly explain how the product works, the scenarios in which it could lose money, and how the final payoff is calculated. Simply saying "this is a high-growth product" is a ‚ùå violation. They must provide the full picture.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 4: Standard V(C) - Record Retention (LOS 91.7.c)</span>

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">4.1 Core Concept</span>
* You must develop and maintain **appropriate records** to support your investment analysis, recommendations, and other investment-related communications.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">4.2 What to Keep</span>
* This includes your research notes, financial models (the actual spreadsheets!), copies of reports from third parties that you used, and records of communications with clients.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">4.3 Who Owns the Records?</span>
* The records are the property of your **firm**. If you leave your job, you cannot take these records with you without the firm's permission. Doing so would violate both this standard and **Standard IV(A) Loyalty**.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">4.4 How Long to Keep Them?</span>
* CFA Institute recommends a **seven-year** minimum retention period, but if local regulations require a longer period, you must follow the stricter rule (as per **Standard I(A)**).

#### <span style="color: #E65100;">4.5 Example üßÆ</span>
* An analyst who published a detailed "sell" report on a company six years ago should still have the original Excel model and research notes that supported that conclusion. If a client or regulator questions that recommendation today, the analyst must be able to produce the records that show they had a **diligent and reasonable basis** for their opinion at the time.

### üéØ Quick Exam-Day Pointers

* **V(A) Diligence:** ‚úÖ Do your homework. Your recommendations must be backed by solid research and analysis.
* **V(B) Communication:** ‚úÖ Be clear and honest. Distinguish between **fact and opinion**, and always highlight the risks and limitations of your analysis.
* **V(C) Record Retention:** ‚úÖ Keep good records to support your work. These records belong to your **firm**, not to you. The recommended retention period is **seven years**.
* **Synergy of the Standards:** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Notice how these work together. Good records (**V(C)**) help you prove you had a reasonable basis (**V(A)**) and communicated properly (**V(B)**).
