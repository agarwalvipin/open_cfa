## Reading 93: Ethics Application 👨‍⚖️

### 🎯 Introduction

This is it. You've learned the Code (Reading 89) and memorized the Standards (Reading 90). Now it's time to see them in action. Reading 93 is your ethics "boot camp," where you move from theory to practice.

This reading is pure application. It presents a series of "mini-cases" or scenarios and forces you to play the role of the compliance officer. Your job is to evaluate the conduct, identify the *specific* Standard being violated, and explain *why* it's a violation. This is *exactly* what you'll be asked to do on the exam. Let's get our hands dirty and analyze these cases.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 1: Applying the Standards (LOS 93.a, 93.b)</span>

Here is a breakdown of the cases presented for each Standard.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">🏛️ Standard I: Professionalism</span>

  * **Standard I(A): Knowledge of the Law**

      * **Case 1 (Overcharging):** A member reports his firm is overcharging clients. The firm only fixes the issue for *some* clients. **Violation:** The member knows a violation is still occurring. He must **dissociate** from the activity, which means he can't work with the clients who are still being overcharged.
      * **Case 2 (Money Laundering):** A member fails to investigate high-risk money laundering transactions just because the client is "long-standing" and "has relationships with the board". **Violation:** You can't ignore your legal duty to investigate suspicious activity, no matter who the client is.
      * **Case 3 (Insider Trading):** A member's relative gives him a "tip" that is clearly material and nonpublic. The member trades on it. **Clear Violation:** This is classic illegal insider trading, which is also a violation of the Standards.

  * **Standard I(C): Misrepresentation**

      * **Case 1 (CEO Social Media):** A CEO of an electric car company posts on social media that he has "secured" private financing at a specific price to take the company private. This is untrue, and he later admits the price was a "joke". **Violation:** This is a knowing misrepresentation intended to mislead investors.
      * **Case 2 (Proposal):** A firm submits a proposal for a pension fund that lists all key personnel. Before the client makes a decision, one of those key people leaves the firm. **Violation:** Failing to inform the potential client of this material change is a **misrepresentation by omission**.

  * **Standard I(D): Misconduct**

      * **Case 1 (Protest):** A member is arrested for minor offenses during a civil disobedience protest related to her personal beliefs. **No Violation (Likely):** The Standard is about conduct that "reflects adversely on their professional reputation, integrity, or competence". Protesting for personal beliefs doesn't necessarily mean you're a dishonest or incompetent investment manager.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">Clients III. Duties to Clients</span>

  * **Standard III(A): Loyalty, Prudence, and Care**

      * **Case 1 (Opt-Out Clause):** A firm puts language in its client agreements that tries to excuse it from acting in the client's best interest or limits the client's right to sue. **Violation:** You cannot "opt out" of the Standards. Client interests *always* come first.
      * **Case 2 (Self-Directed Account):** A member executes trades for a *self-directed* margin account. The client knows the margin policies and is making his own decisions. **No Violation:** The member's duty is different here than in an advisory role. He is not providing advice, so his duty is to execute the client's trades and act in good faith according to the firm's policies.

  * **Standard III(D): Performance Presentation**

      * **Case 1 (Simulated Performance):** A firm presents performance from a "simulated" fund, giving the impression it's a real, long-running fund when it's actually new. **Violation:** This is not a fair, accurate, and complete presentation. It's misleading.

  * **Standard III(E): Preservation of Confidentiality**

      * **Case 1 (WFH Hack):** A member downloads confidential client data to his *personal* server at home to make working from home easier. He gets hacked. **Violation:** He violated the Standard by failing to take reasonable steps to protect client information. His compliance head *also* likely violated the Standard by not having proper safeguards in place to *prevent* such a download.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">Employers IV. Duties to Employers</span>

  * **Standard IV(A): Loyalty**

      * **Case 1 (Bad-Mouthing):** A member, while still employed at Firm A, makes harmful statements about Firm A and actively promotes the new firm she plans to join. **Violation:** She must act in her employer's best interest *until her resignation is effective*.
      * **Case 2 (Proprietary Products):** A member is pressured to sell his firm's own expensive, underperforming products. **This is a CONFLICT:** His duty to his *client* (Standard III(A)) comes before his duty to his *employer* (Standard IV(A)). He must put the client's interest first, which means not recommending unsuitable or bad products.

  * **Standard IV(C): Responsibilities of Supervisors**

      * **Case 1 (No Authority):** A member is given the title of "supervisor" but is not allowed to contact clients, review communications, or enforce company policies. **Violation:** The member is in violation by *accepting* this role. She knows she cannot fulfill her supervisory duties to detect and prevent violations. She should have **declined to accept supervisory responsibility** in writing.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">Analysis V. Investment Analysis, Recommendations, and Actions</span>

  * **Standard V(A): Diligence and Reasonable Basis**

      * **Case 1 (No Research):** Member 1 recommends a stock without doing any diligent, independent analysis. Member 2 then uses Member 1's report as the basis for her *own* recommendation. **Both are in Violation:** Member 1 had no reasonable basis. Member 2 violated the Standard by not doing her *own* diligence and just piggybacking on unverified research.

  * **Standard V(B): Communication with Clients**

      * **Case 1 (Rating Agency):** A credit rating agency *changes its methodology* for rating securities but doesn't disclose this change to clients. **Violation:** This is a material change to the investment process that must be disclosed.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">Conflicts VI. Conflicts of Interest</span>

  * **Standard VI(B): Priority of Transactions**

      * **Case 1 (Block Trades):** A member groups client trades into block orders. After the market closes, he allocates the *profitable* trades to his personal accounts and a disproportionate number of *losing* trades to his largest client accounts. **Violation:** This is a severe breach. He is putting his personal interests not only before his clients' but *directly harming* his clients for his own gain.

  * **Standard VI(C): Referral Fees**

      * **Case 1 (Lavish Parties):** A member rewards existing clients who refer new, profitable accounts with "lavish parties, discounts on fees, and gift cards". **Violation:** This is a referral fee. It's not a violation to *pay* it, but it **is a violation to not disclose it** to *all* existing and prospective clients. They need to know she is paying for referrals.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">CFA VII. Responsibilities as a CFA Institute Member or CFA Candidate</span>

  * **Standard VII(A): Conduct as Participants in CFA Institute Programs**
      * **Case 1 (Post-Exam Party):** A member who teaches prep classes hosts a party for candidates after the exam. He asks them for "general impressions about the difficulty" and their "opinions on the most difficult exam questions". **Violation:** This conduct compromises the integrity and security of the exam. He is soliciting confidential exam content.

### 🎯 Quick Exam-Day Pointers

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

  * **It's All About Application:** The exam won't just ask "What is Standard IV(A)?" It will give you a story (like the ones above) and ask, "Did the member violate the Standards?"
  * **Identify the Core Conflict:** In every scenario, ask: Who is being harmed? Is it the client? The employer? The market? Your own integrity?
  * **Client > Employer > Self:** This hierarchy solves many dilemmas. Your duty to your client (III.A) trumps your duty to your employer (IV.A).
  * **Dissociate:** If you know a violation is occurring (like in I(A), Case 1), you *must* take steps to dissociate. This may mean reporting it, declining to work on the project, or, in extreme cases, resigning.
  * **Omission is a Violation:** Failing to disclose something material (like a personnel change in I(C) or a methodology change in V(B)) is a form of misrepresentation.
  * **Supervisor Responsibility:** A supervisor's job is to *prevent* and *detect* violations (IV(C)). If you are a supervisor in name only with no real authority, you must decline the role, or you will be held responsible for violations that occur under you.
