## Reading 93: Application of the Code and Standards üöÄ

### **üéØ Introduction: From Rulebook to Real World**

Think of learning the Code and Standards like learning the rules of chess. ‚ôüÔ∏è You know how the pawns move, what a checkmate is, and what the knight can do. But knowing the rules is very different from playing an actual game. "Ethics Application" is your first chess match. It's where you take the rules you've memorized and apply them to complex, real-world scenarios (**vignettes**) to determine the best move. This reading is designed to turn you from someone who *knows* the rules into someone who can *think* like an ethical professional.

### **Part 1: A Framework for Answering Ethics Questions ü§î**

When you face an ethics vignette on the exam, it can feel overwhelming. The key is to have a systematic approach to break it down. Here is a simple framework:

1.  **Identify the Actors and their Duties:** Who are the key people involved? What are their roles (analyst, portfolio manager, supervisor)? Who are their duties owed to (clients, employer, the market)?
2.  **Identify the Conduct:** What specific actions did the individuals take or fail to take? Focus on the behavior.
3.  **Identify the Potential Violations:** Based on the conduct, which Standard(s) seem most relevant? Is it an issue of loyalty? Fair dealing? A conflict of interest?
4.  **Apply the Code and Standards:** Match the conduct to the specific rules within the Standards. Does the action directly violate a provision?
5.  **Determine the Best Course of Action:** The question will often ask if a standard was violated, or what the person should do next. The correct answer will always be the one most consistent with the Code and Standards.

### **Part 2: Common Exam Scenarios and How to Tackle Them ‚úçÔ∏è**


Ethics questions often revolve around a few classic situations. Here‚Äôs how to spot them and which Standards are likely at play.

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### üéÅ The Lavish Gift

**Scenario:** An analyst receives an expensive gift, a luxurious trip, or special access from a company they cover.
**Core Conflict:** The gift could compromise the analyst's **Independence and Objectivity**.
**Relevant Standard:** **Standard I(B)**.
**How to Act:** The analyst should reject the gift or insist on paying for it themselves. Modest gifts and entertainment are okay; lavish ones are not.

#### üö∂ Leaving a Firm

**Scenario:** An employee is preparing to leave their job to start a competing firm. Before leaving, they solicit clients or take proprietary materials.
**Core Conflict:** The employee has a duty of **Loyalty** to their current employer.
**Relevant Standard:** **Standard IV(A)**.
**How to Act:** The employee can *prepare* to leave (e.g., arrange for office space) but cannot compete or solicit clients until after their resignation is effective. They cannot take client lists or firm property.

----

#### ü§´ The Secret Tip

**Scenario:** A member or candidate receives a tip about a company from an insider before it is made public.
**Core Conflict:** Acting on this information would be trading on **Material Nonpublic Information**.
**Relevant Standard:** **Standard II(A)**.
**How to Act:** The member **must not** act on the information or cause others to act. They should encourage the company to make the information public.

----

#### ‚öñÔ∏è Unequal Treatment

**Scenario:** A portfolio manager informs their largest clients about a new "buy" recommendation before telling smaller clients.
**Core Conflict:** All clients must be treated with **Fair Dealing**.
**Relevant Standard:** **Standard III(B)**.
**How to Act:** The manager must disseminate the recommendation to all suitable clients at roughly the same time.

> [!TIP]
> **CFA Exam Tip ‚úçÔ∏è:** The most difficult ethics questions often involve multiple, subtle issues. Your job is to identify the **primary** violation. Read the question carefully: is it asking what the member *did* wrong, or what they *should do* next? The answer might change depending on the question's focus.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### üéØ Quick Exam-Day Pointers
> * **The Strictest Rule Applies:** Always follow the rule that is most strict, whether it's local law, firm policy, or the CFA Code and Standards.
> * **Focus on the ACTION:** Your analysis should center on the actions taken (or not taken) by the person in the vignette. Don't get lost in their intentions.
> * **Clients > Employer > You:** Remember the hierarchy of loyalty. In any conflict, the client's interests come first, then your employer's, and your own personal interests always come last.
> * **Read the Vignette and Question Carefully:** Sometimes, a small detail can change the entire context. Pay close attention to every piece of information provided.
