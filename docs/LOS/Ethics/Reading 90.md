### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 1: The Six Commandments of the Code of Ethics (LOS 90.a)</span>

The <strong>Code of Ethics</strong> is the high-level summary of your ethical responsibilities. It's the spirit of the law, not the letter. There are six core principles you must pledge to follow. Think of them as your professional creed.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.1 The Six Principles</span>

* <strong>Act with Integrity & Honesty 🙏:</strong> Always act in an honest, ethical, and professional manner. This is the bedrock of everything. No cutting corners! ✅
* <strong>Client's Interest First 🥇:</strong> Place the integrity of the investment profession and the interests of clients above your own personal interests. Your clients' financial well-being is your top priority. ⬆️
* <strong>Reasonable Care & Independent Judgment 🧠:</strong> Use your skills, diligence, and independent professional judgment when making investment recommendations or taking action. Don't just follow the herd—do your own homework! →
* <strong>Promote Integrity in Markets 🏛️:</strong> Practice and encourage others to practice in a professional and ethical manner that will reflect credit on themselves and the profession. Uphold the reputation of the financial world. ✅

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 2: The Seven Pillars - Standards of Professional Conduct (LOS 90.b)</span>

If the Code of Ethics is the "what," the <strong>Standards of Professional Conduct</strong> are the "how." They are seven categories of detailed rules that bring the Code to life.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.1 I. Professionalism</span>

This standard is all about your personal integrity and competence.

##### <span style="color: #E65100;">2.1.1 (A) Knowledge of the Law ⚖️</span>
* You must understand and comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. This includes the CFA Code and Standards! If there's a conflict between different laws, you must follow the <strong>strictest</strong> one. ✅

#### <span style="color: #00838F;">2.1.2 Global & Local Context 🌍</span>
* An investment advisor in India must follow SEBI regulations. If they also manage money for a US client, they must also be aware of SEC rules. If a specific SEBI rule is stricter than an SEC rule, the SEBI rule must be followed for that client.

##### <span style="color: #E65100;">2.1.3 (B) Independence and Objectivity 🎯</span>
* Do not let anything compromise your professional judgment. This means avoiding or disclosing any gifts, benefits, or compensation that could create a conflict of interest. ❌

* <strong>Example:</strong> A research analyst from Motilal Oswal should not accept a lavish, all-expenses-paid "research trip" to a luxury resort from a company they are covering. A modest lunch is okay, but anything that could sway their opinion is a violation.

##### <span style="color: #E65100;">2.1.4 (C) Misrepresentation 🤥</span>
* You cannot knowingly make any misrepresentations related to investment analysis, recommendations, or other professional activities. This means no plagiarism, no promising guaranteed high returns, and being honest about your qualifications. ❌

##### <span style="color: #E65100;">2.1.5 (D) Misconduct 🚫</span>
* Don't be dishonest, fraudulent, or deceitful. This standard covers conduct that might not be illegal but reflects poorly on your professional reputation, integrity, or competence. ❌

💡 CFA Exam Tip ✍️:For Standard I(A) Knowledge of the Law, exam questions often test the <strong>follow the stricter law</strong> rule. They might present a scenario where a country's local law is less strict than the CFA Code and Standards. The correct answer is always to adhere to the more stringent rule! ✅

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.2 II. Integrity of Capital Markets</span>

This is about keeping the playing field level for all investors.

##### <span style="color: #E65100;">2.2.1 (A) Material Nonpublic Information 🤫</span>
* You cannot act or cause others to act on <strong>material nonpublic information</strong> (MNPI). ❌

  * <strong>Material Information:</strong> Information that would significantly alter the total mix of information currently available and would likely affect a stock's price.
  * <strong>Nonpublic Information:</strong> Information that has not been disseminated to the general marketplace.
  * <strong>Example:</strong> A financial analyst at HDFC Bank learns from a client (a senior executive at Infosys) that Infosys is about to announce a surprise massive loss. This is MNPI. The analyst cannot sell their Infosys shares, nor can they tell their colleagues or other clients to sell. Doing so is classic <strong>insider trading</strong>. ❌

##### <span style="color: #E65100;">2.2.2 (B) Market Manipulation 🎭</span>
* You cannot engage in practices that distort prices or artificially inflate trading volume to mislead market participants. This includes spreading false rumors to drive a stock price up or down. ❌

-----

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.3 III. Duties to Clients</span>

This section is huge on the exam. It's all about loyalty, prudence, and care.

##### <span style="color: #E65100;">2.3.1 (A) Loyalty, Prudence, and Care ❤️</span>
* You have a duty of loyalty to your clients and must act with reasonable care and exercise prudent judgment. You must always act for their benefit, not your own. ✅

##### <span style="color: #E65100;">2.3.2 (B) Fair Dealing ⚖️</span>
* Treat all clients fairly when making investment recommendations or taking investment action. You can't favor your large, wealthy clients over your smaller retail clients. ❌

  * <strong>Example:</strong> If you decide a stock is a "buy," you must inform all clients for whom the investment is suitable at roughly the same time. You can't call your biggest client first, let them trade, and then inform others after the price has already moved. ❌

##### <span style="color: #E65100;">2.3.3 (C) Suitability 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦</span>
* When you are in an advisory relationship, you must make a reasonable inquiry into a client’s investment experience, risk/return objectives, and financial constraints <strong>before</strong> making any recommendation. You must then judge whether an investment is suitable for them. ✅

##### <span style="color: #E65100;">2.3.4 (D) Performance Presentation 📊</span>
* When communicating investment performance information, make sure it is fair, accurate, and complete. Don't cherry-pick your best-performing accounts to show to prospective clients. ❌

##### <span style="color: #E65100;">2.3.5 (E) Preservation of Confidentiality 🤐</span>
* Keep information about current, former, and prospective clients confidential unless the client permits disclosure, the information concerns illegal activities, or you are legally required to disclose it. ✅

<div style="background-color: #E3F2FD; border-left: 5px solid #1976D2; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">
💡 CFA Exam Tip ✍️:The difference between Standard III(A) Loyalty and Standard VI(A) Disclosure of Conflicts is critical. <strong>Loyalty</strong> means putting clients first. <strong>Disclosure</strong> means being transparent about potential conflicts. Sometimes, even with full disclosure, a conflict is so great that you cannot proceed because it would violate your duty of loyalty. ❌

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.4 IV. Duties to Employers</span>

Your loyalty isn't just to clients; you also have duties to your employer.

##### <span style="color: #E65100;">2.4.1 (A) Loyalty 🏢</span>
* In matters related to your employment, you must act for the benefit of your employer and not deprive them of your skills, or divulge confidential information. However, this doesn't mean you have to sacrifice your ethics for your company! ✅

##### <span style="color: #E65100;">2.4.2 (B) Additional Compensation Arrangements 💰</span>
* You cannot accept gifts, benefits, or compensation that competes with your employer's interest unless you get written consent from <strong>all parties involved</strong>. ❌

##### <span style="color: #E65100;">2.4.3 (C) Responsibilities of Supervisors 👮</span>
* You must make reasonable efforts to ensure that anyone you supervise complies with applicable laws and the Code and Standards. ✅

##### <span style="color: #E65100;">2.5.3 (C) Record Retention 📂</span>
* You must develop and maintain appropriate records to support your investment analysis and recommendations. ✅

-----

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.6 VI. Conflicts of Interest</span>

Conflicts are everywhere. The key is how you handle them.

##### <span style="color: #E65100;">2.6.1 (A) Disclosure of Conflicts 📄</span>
* You must make full and fair disclosure of all matters that could reasonably be expected to impair your independence and objectivity. Disclosures should be prominent and clear. ✅

##### <span style="color: #E65100;">2.6.2 (B) Priority of Transactions 🥇</span>
* Investment transactions for clients and employers must have priority over transactions in which you are the <strong>beneficial owner</strong>. This means you trade for your clients first, your employer second, and yourself last. ⬇️

##### <span style="color: #E65100;">2.6.3 (C) Referral Fees 💸</span>
* You must disclose to your employer, clients, and prospective clients, as appropriate, any compensation received for the recommendation of products or services. ✅

##### <span style="color: #E65100;">2.7.1 (A) Conduct as Participants in CFA Institute Programs 🧑‍🎓</span>

##### <span style="color: #E65100;">2.7.2 (B) Reference to CFA Institute, the CFA Designation, and the CFA Program 🏅</span>
* When referring to your participation, you must not misrepresent or exaggerate the meaning of membership, holding the designation, or being a candidate.
  * <strong>Correct:</strong> "I am a CFA charterholder." ✅
  * <strong>Incorrect:</strong> "I am a CFA." or "I am a Level III CFA." (There's no such thing). ❌

### 🎯 Quick Exam-Day Pointers

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">
* <strong>Strictest Law Applies:</strong> Always remember to follow the most stringent rule, whether it's local law, your firm's policy, or the CFA Code and Standards. ✅
* <strong>Client ⬆️ Employer ⬆️ You:</strong> In cases of loyalty and priority of transactions, the client always comes first, followed by your employer, and finally your own personal interests.
* <strong>Disclosure is Key, But Not a Cure-All:</strong> Disclosing a conflict of interest is necessary, but it doesn't solve everything. If the conflict is too great, you may need to decline the business to maintain your duty of loyalty. ❌
* <strong>MNPI - Don't Act, Don't Share:</strong> If you receive Material Nonpublic Information, your only options are to not act and not tell anyone else. Encourage the company to make the information public. ❌
* <strong>Suitability is a Snapshot in Time:</strong> A client's situation can change. You must reassess suitability regularly and update their <strong>Investment Policy Statement (IPS)</strong>. ⬇️
