Here is a detailed summary of Reading 90.

## Reading 90: Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct ⚖️

### 🎯 Introduction

Welcome to the absolute core of the CFA Program. Reading 90 isn't just another topic—it's the **moral compass** for the entire investment profession. This is where you learn the rules of the road, the very principles that separate a true professional from just another person in finance.

This reading introduces the six components of the **Code of Ethics** (the high-level principles you must adopt) and the seven **Standards of Professional Conduct** (the specific, enforceable rules you must follow). We'll also cover how CFA Institute enforces these rules through the Professional Conduct Program.

Mastering this material is non-negotiable, not just for the exam, but for earning and keeping the trust that is the foundation of our industry. Let's dive in.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 1: How the Rules are Enforced (LOS 90.a)</span>

CFA Institute isn't just a publisher of books; it's a professional body with a serious enforcement arm called the **Professional Conduct Program (PCP)**. Its job is to investigate potential violations of the Code and Standards.

The whole process is governed by the CFA Institute Bylaws and the Rules of Procedure for Professional Conduct. It's built on two key principles:

1.  **Fairness** to members and candidates.
2.  **Confidentiality** of the proceedings.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">How Does an Inquiry Start?</span>

An investigation isn't random. The Professional Conduct (PC) staff will start an inquiry based on several triggers:

  * **Self-Disclosure:** You report yourself on your annual Professional Conduct Statement (e.g., you were involved in a civil lawsuit or criminal investigation).
  * **Written Complaints:** Someone (like a client, coworker, or employer) submits a formal complaint.
  * **Public Information:** PC staff discovers potential misconduct through media reports or regulatory notices.
  * **Exam Proctors:** A proctor reports a possible violation during the CFA exam.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">What Happens During the Inquiry?</span>

Here's a simplified flowchart of the process:

    A[Inquiry Triggered] --> B{PC Staff Conducts Inquiry};
    B --> C[Interviews, Info Requests, Document Review];
    C --> D{Violation?};
    D -- No --> E[Case Dropped];
    D -- Yes --> F[Staff Proposes Sanction];
    F --> G{Candidate/Member Accepts?};
    G -- Yes --> H[Sanction Imposed, Case Closed];
    G -- No --> I[Case Referred to Disciplinary Review Panel];
    I --> J[Panel Hearing];
    J --> H;

    style E fill:#E8F5E9,stroke:#4CAF50
    style H fill:#FFCCCB,stroke:#D32F2F
```

If the PC staff believes a violation occurred, they may propose a **disciplinary sanction**. You have a choice:

1.  **Accept** the sanction.
2.  **Reject** the sanction. If you reject it, the case goes to a hearing with a **disciplinary review panel** composed of CFA Institute members.

Sanctions can range from a private condemnation all the way to **suspension of your membership and right to use the CFA designation**, or even suspension from the CFA Program for candidates.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 2: The Code of Ethics (LOS 90.b)</span>

The Code of Ethics is the high-level, principle-based pledge that all members and candidates must adhere to. There are **six components**. Think of these as the fundamental ideals you must uphold.

**The Six Components of the Code of Ethics:**

Members and Candidates must:

1.  Act with **integrity, competence, diligence, respect,** and in an **ethical manner** with the public, clients, prospective clients, employers, employees, colleagues in the investment profession, and other participants in the global capital markets.
2.  Place the **integrity of the investment profession** and the **interests of clients** above their own personal interests.
3.  Use **reasonable care** and exercise **independent professional judgment** when conducting investment analysis, making investment recommendations, taking investment action, and engaging in other professional activities.
4.  **Practice and encourage others to practice** in a professional and ethical manner that will reflect credit on themselves and the profession.
5.  **Promote the integrity** and **viability of the global capital markets** for the ultimate benefit of society.
6.  **Maintain and improve** their **professional competence** and strive to maintain and improve the competence of other investment professionals.
