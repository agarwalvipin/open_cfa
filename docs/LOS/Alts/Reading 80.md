## Reading 80: Natural Resource

### üéØ Introduction

Get ready to get your hands dirty! If stocks and bonds are the engines of a portfolio, **Natural Resources** are the raw fuel and the fertile ground beneath our feet. We're moving beyond produced assets like buildings and infrastructure to the very source of economic production: the **farmland** that grows our food, the **timberland** that provides our lumber, and the **commodities** like oil and gold that power our industries.

These are real, tangible assets with unique risks (hello, weather! ‚õàÔ∏è) and powerful benefits, especially as a hedge against inflation. Let's dig in!

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 1: Investing in the Land - Farmland & Timberland üöú (LOS 80.a)</span>

Investing in land like farmland and timberland is similar to real estate‚Äîit's illiquid and each parcel is unique. However, the key difference is that its value comes from its **biological, productive capacity** (soil quality, climate) rather than from physical buildings on it.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.1 Farmland vs. Timberland: Overview</span>

* **Farmland**
  * **What it is:** Investing in land used for growing crops (wheat, corn, fruits) or for pastureland.
  * **Return Drivers:**
    * **Income:** From selling harvested crops or leasing the land to farmers.
    * **Land Appreciation:** The value of the land itself can increase over time.
  * **Key Feature:** **Inflexible Harvest Cycle** ‚è∞ ‚Äî crops must be harvested when ripe (e.g., sugarcane in Maharashtra; wheat in Punjab).

* **Timberland**
  * **What it is:** Investing in forests harvested for lumber.
  * **Return Drivers:**
    * **Biological Growth:** Trees increase in volume and value over time.
    * **Lumber Prices:** Market price movements for timber.
    * **Land Appreciation:** Underlying land value.
  * **Key Feature:** **Flexible Harvest Cycle** ‚úÖ ‚Äî owners can delay harvest to wait for better prices; acts as both a factory (growing trees) and a warehouse (storing value on the stump).

* **Investment Vehicles:** Institutions use TIMOs (Timberland Investment Management Organizations) or farmland REITs/ETPs for exposure.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.2 Investment Characteristics & Risks</span>

* **Liquidity:** Illiquid; transactions are infrequent and parcel-specific.
* **Valuation:** Valuations often rely on infrequent appraisals ‚Üí reported volatility may be **smoothed**.
* **Major Risks:**
  * **Weather & Disease:** ‚õàÔ∏è crop failure, pests.
  * **Regulatory:** Land-use changes, zoning, environmental rules.
  * **Market:** Commodity price swings for crops or lumber.

#### <span style="color: #00838F;">1.4 Global & Local Context üåç</span>

* **Global Example:** U.S. farmland values often reflect mechanization and scale economies (e.g., Midwestern row-crop farms benefiting from productivity gains), while timberland in Scandinavia benefits from long-term managed forestry and stable markets.
* **India/Local Example:** Indian sugarcane farmland in Maharashtra faces rigid harvest cycles and regulatory support/prices; Indian timber investments are smaller but growing with plantation forestry and agroforestry initiatives.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 2: Commodities - The Building Blocks of the Economy üõ¢Ô∏è (LOS 80.b)</span>

**Commodities** are standardized raw materials. They don't generate cash flow on their own; returns come from price changes.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.1 Commodity Types</span>

* **Hard Commodities:** Mined or extracted (e.g., crude oil, copper, gold).
* **Soft Commodities:** Grown (e.g., wheat, coffee, cotton).

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.2 How to Invest in Commodities</span>

* **Derivatives (Futures & Forwards):** Liquid and efficient exposure; common for institutional traders.
* **Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs):** ETFs/ETNs that track commodity prices (e.g., Gold ETF on the NSE).
* **Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs):** Managed funds using trend-following strategies in futures markets.
* **Physical Holdings:** Rare for most investors due to storage and insurance costs.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.3 Contango & Backwardation</span>

This core concept links spot and futures markets via the **cost of carry** (storage, insurance, financing) and the **convenience yield** (benefit of holding the physical).

**Convenience Yield:** Non-monetary value of having the physical commodity now ‚Äî high when inventories are low or scarcity risk exists.

##### <span style="color: #E65100;">2.3.1 Contango</span>

* **Definition:** Futures > Spot; forward curve slopes **upward**.
* **Cause:** **Cost of carry** > **Convenience yield**.
* **Impact:** ‚Üí **Negative roll yield** for long-only futures investors (selling cheap expiring contract and buying a more expensive one).

##### <span style="color: #E65100;">2.3.2 Backwardation</span>

* **Definition:** Spot > Futures; forward curve slopes **downward**.
* **Cause:** **Convenience yield** > **Cost of carry** (shortage or tight inventories).
* **Impact:** ‚Üí **Positive roll yield** for long-only investors (rolling into a cheaper contract).

#### <span style="color: #00838F;">2.4 Global & Local Context üåç</span>

* **Global Example:** Oil market backwardation during tight supply (e.g., post-supply shocks) can benefit long crude futures holders via roll yield.
* **India/Local Example:** Gold demand in India (jewelry, festivals) influences spot premiums and convenience yield; domestic storage/transport costs affect forward curves for local ETPs.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 3: Risk, Return & Portfolio Benefits ‚öñÔ∏è (LOS 80.c)</span>

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">3.1 Inflation Hedging</span>

* **Commodities:** Strong inflation hedge ‚Äî commodity prices feed directly into CPI components.
* **Farmland & Timberland:** Decent hedges ‚Äî hold value in inflation but less direct than commodities.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">3.2 Diversification</span>

* **Farmland & Timberland:** Outstanding diversifiers ‚Äî historically low correlation with stocks and bonds; note appraisal smoothing can understate true volatility.
* **Commodities:** Low-to-moderate correlation with stocks; very low with bonds.

#### <span style="color: #00838F;">3.4 Global & Local Context üåç</span>

* **Global Example:** Commodities often perform well during global inflationary periods (e.g., oil and food price spikes during supply shocks), providing portfolio protection.
* **India/Local Example:** In India, agricultural commodity cycles (monsoon variability) and gold demand (festivals/weddings) materially influence local commodity prices and investment flows.

üí° CFA Exam Tip ‚úçÔ∏è:**Contango vs. Backwardation** is core. Visual: Contango's curve goes **up** (C**up**), Backwardation goes **down**. Know drivers (cost of carry vs. convenience yield) and the impact on long futures investors. Remember: **Commodities** = best inflation hedge; **Farmland/Timberland** = best diversifiers.
