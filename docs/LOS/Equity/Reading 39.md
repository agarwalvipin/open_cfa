## Reading 39: Market Organization and Structure 🏛️

### 🎯 Introduction

Welcome to the marketplace\! Think of the financial system as the world's most complex and gigantic market. It's the "where" and "how" for every single transaction we'll study. Before you can analyze a security (like a stock or bond), you must first understand the *arena* in which it trades.

This reading is your map of that arena. We'll learn the system's functions, identify the different assets you can trade, meet the key players (intermediaries), and learn the rules of engagement—from how you place an order to the risks of borrowing (leverage). This is the foundational plumbing of all financial markets.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 1: The System & Its Players (LOS 39.a, 39.b, 39.c, 39.d)</span>

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.1 Functions of the Financial System (LOS 39.a)</span>

The financial system isn't just "where stocks trade." It has three core functions:

1.  **To Allow Entities to...** save, borrow, raise equity capital, manage risks, trade assets, and utilize information.
2.  **To Determine Returns:** It's the mechanism that finds the equilibrium interest rate—the price that equates the total supply of savings with the total demand for borrowing.
3.  **To Allocate Capital:** It channels money from those who have it (savers) to those who can use it most productively (e.g., companies building factories, governments building roads).

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.2 Classifying Assets and Markets (LOS 39.b)</span>

  * **Securities:**
      * **Debt vs. Equity:** Debt securities are loans (e.g., bonds) ; equity securities represent ownership (e.g., stocks).
      * **Public vs. Private:** Public securities (like S\&P 500 stocks) trade on exchanges and are regulated. Private securities (like venture capital stakes) are non-public, illiquid, and less regulated.
  * **Derivatives vs. Physical Assets:**
      * **Physical (Real) Assets:** Tangible assets like real estate, equipment, or commodities.
      * **Derivative Contracts:** Their value is *derived* from an underlying asset (e.g., stock options, commodity futures).
  * **Markets:**
      * **Spot vs. Future/Forward:** Spot markets are for immediate delivery (e.g., buying a stock *now*). Forward/futures markets are for delivery at a future date.
      * **Money vs. Capital:** Money markets are for short-term debt (<1 year). Capital markets are for long-term debt and equity.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.3 The "What": Assets, Contracts, & Currencies (LOS 39.c)</span>

  * **Securities:**
      * **Fixed Income:** Bonds (long-term), Notes (intermediate-term), Commercial Paper (short-term corporate debt), Bills (short-term government debt), CDs, Repos.
      * **Equity:** Common Stock (residual claim, voting rights) , Preferred Stock (fixed dividend, no voting rights), Warrants (options issued by a firm).
      * **Pooled Investments:** Mutual Funds, ETFs, Hedge Funds, Asset-Backed Securities.
  * **Contracts:** Futures, Forwards, Options, Swaps, and Insurance contracts (including Credit Default Swaps).
  * **Currencies:** Issued by central banks, traded in spot and derivative markets.
  * **Commodities:** Precious metals, energy, agricultural products.
  * **Real Assets:** Real estate, machinery, etc.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.4 The "Who": Financial Intermediaries (LOS 39.d)</span>

These are the "middlemen" who make the market work.

  * **Brokers:** Agents who find counterparties for their clients' trades (they don't trade themselves).
  * **Dealers (Market Makers):** Principals who trade with their clients. They *hold an inventory* of securities and profit from the **bid-ask spread**.
  * **Investment Banks:** Help corporations raise capital (e.g., in an IPO) and provide advice on mergers.
  * **Securitizers:** Pool assets (like mortgages), create securities based on them (tranches), and sell them to investors.
  * **Depository Institutions (Banks):** Take deposits and make loans.
  * **Arbitrageurs:** Exploit price differences for the *same asset* in different markets, enforcing price consistency.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 2: Placing a Trade (LOS 39.e, 39.f, 39.g, 39.h)</span>

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.1 Positions: Long vs. Short (LOS 39.e)</span>

  * **Long Position:** You *own* an asset. You profit if the price **goes up**. (Buy low, sell high) .
  * **Short Position (Short Sale):** You *sell an asset you don't own*. You do this by borrowing it from a broker, selling it, and hoping to buy it back later at a lower price to return it. You profit if the price **goes down**.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.2 Leveraged Positions: Margin (LOS 39.f)</span>

  * **Leverage:** Using *borrowed funds* to purchase an asset. This **magnifies both gains and losses**.
  * **Buying on Margin:** Borrowing money from your broker to buy a stock. The loan is called a **margin loan**, and the interest rate is the **call money rate**.
  * **Initial Margin Requirement:** The *minimum* percentage of the purchase price that you must provide as your own equity (e.g., 50%).
  * **Maintenance Margin:** The *minimum* equity percentage you must maintain in your account. If your equity drops below this (because the stock price fell), you get a **Margin Call**—a demand from your broker to deposit more cash or sell the stock.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.3 Order Instructions (LOS 39.g, 39.h)</span>

How you tell your broker *what* to do, *when* to do it, and *how* to settle it.

  *

      * **Market Order:** "Get it done NOW at the best available price." Guarantees execution, not price.
      * **Limit Order:** "Execute only at *this price or better*." Guarantees price, not execution.
          * A **Limit Buy** order is placed *below* the current price.
          * A **Limit Sell** order is placed *above* the current price.
          * An order with a limit price between the best bid and ask is "making a new market".

  * **Validity Instructions:**

      * **Day Order:** Good for this trading day only.
      * **Good-'til-Canceled (GTC):** Stays active until you cancel it.
      * **Stop Order (or Stop-Loss):** An order that triggers a *market order* once a "stop price" is hit. Used to limit losses or lock in profits.
          * **Stop-Sell:** Placed *below* the current price. If the stock falls to $45, it triggers a market order to sell.
          * **Stop-Buy:** Placed *above* the current price. Used by short sellers to cover their position if the price rises against them.

  * **Clearing Instructions:** How to settle the trade (e.g., "sell short").

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 3: Market Arenas & Rules (LOS 39.i, 39.j, 39.k, 39.l)</span>

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">3.1 Primary vs. Secondary Markets (LOS 39.i)</span>

  * **Primary Market:** Where securities are **created and sold for the first time**. The company (issuer) receives the cash.
      * **Initial Public Offering (IPO):** A private company sells shares to the public for the first time.
      * **Private Placement:** A company sells securities directly to a small group of qualified investors.
  * **Secondary Market:** Where **existing securities** are traded among investors (e.g., the NYSE). The company is *not* involved in the transaction.
  * **Why does the Secondary Market matter?** It provides **liquidity** and **price discovery**. Without a liquid secondary market to sell in, investors would be unwilling to buy in the primary market.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">3.2 How Markets are Structured (LOS 39.j)</span>

1.  **Quote-Driven Markets (Dealer Markets):** Investors trade with *dealers (market makers)* who post "bid" and "ask" prices. Most bonds and currencies trade this way.
2.  **Order-Driven Markets:** All buyers and sellers post their orders, and an exchange's computer *matches* them using rules (e.g., "best price priority, then earliest order priority"). This is how most stock exchanges (like NYSE) work.
3.  **Brokered Markets:** Brokers find a counterparty for a trade, usually for unique or illiquid assets (e.g., large blocks of stock, real estate).

<!-- end list -->

  * **Call vs. Continuous Markets:** **Call markets** trade only at specific times (e.g., an opening auction). **Continuous markets** trade any time the market is open.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">3.3 A Well-Functioning Financial System (LOS 39.k)</span>

A good system is:

  * **Complete:** Lets you save, borrow, hedge, and trade easily.
  * **Operationally Efficient:** Trading costs (commissions, bid-ask spreads) are low.
  * **Informationally Efficient:** Prices reflect all available information quickly and accurately.
  * **Allocationally Efficient:** Capital gets directed to its highest-value use.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">3.4 Objectives of Market Regulation (LOS 39.l)</span>

Regulators (like the SEC in the U.S.) aim to:

  * **Protect Investors:** Prevent fraud and theft.
  * **Ensure Market Fairness:** Prohibit insider trading, which erodes market confidence.
  * **Promote Efficiency:** Require disclosures so investors have information.
  * **Reduce Systemic Risk:** Prevent the failure of one firm from collapsing the whole system.

### 🎯 Quick Exam-Day Pointers

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

  * **Intermediaries:** Know the difference: **Brokers** are *agents* (no inventory). **Dealers** are *principals* (hold inventory, profit from bid-ask spread).
  * **Positions:** **Long = Profit from Price Up**. **Short = Profit from Price Down**.
  * **Margin:** **Leverage magnifies gains AND losses**. A **Margin Call** happens when your equity % drops below the **Maintenance Margin**.
  * **Orders:**
      * **Market Order:** Guarantees *execution*, not price.
      * **Limit Order:** Guarantees *price*, not execution.
      * **Stop-Sell Order:** Triggers a *market sell* when the price *falls* to your stop price.
  * **Markets:**
      * **Primary vs. Secondary:** Primary = *New* securities (IPO). Secondary = *Existing* securities (NYSE).
      * **Order-Driven:** *Matches* orders (stocks). **Quote-Driven:** *Dealers* provide liquidity (bonds).
  * **Regulation:** Its main goals are investor protection, fairness (no insider trading), and preventing systemic risk.
