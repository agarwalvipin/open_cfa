## <span style="color: #1565C0;">Reading 42: Overview of Equity Securities üöÄ</span>

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">üéØ Introduction</span>

Imagine you own a tiny slice of your favorite coffee shop. That slice is **equity**. It gives you a claim to a share of the profits (your dividend!) and a say in the big decisions (your vote!). In the corporate world, **equity securities** represent this ownership stake in a company. They are the engine of wealth creation for investors and a vital source of capital for businesses to grow and innovate. This reading breaks down the different types of equity, how they're traded, and how we measure their performance.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 1: The Different Flavors of Equity üçï (LOS 42.a)</span>

Not all equity is created equal. The two main types are common stock and preferred stock, each with different rights and features.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.1 Common Stock (Common Shares)</span>

* **Ownership & Control:** Common shareholders are the ultimate owners of the company. They have **voting rights**, which allow them to elect the board of directors and vote on major corporate matters.
  * **Statutory Voting:** You get one vote per share for each board seat. If you have 100 shares and there are 3 seats up for election, you can cast 100 votes for a candidate in each of the 3 elections.
  * **Cumulative Voting:** You can pool your votes. With 100 shares and 3 seats, you have 300 total votes (100 shares x 3 seats) and can cast all 300 for a single candidate. This gives minority shareholders a better chance at representation.
* **Claim on Assets & Income:** They have a **residual claim**. This means they are last in line to get paid. If the company is liquidated, creditors and preferred shareholders get their money back before common shareholders see a single rupee.
* **Dividends:** Dividends are not guaranteed. The company's board decides if and when to pay them.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.2 Preferred Stock (Preference Shares)</span>

* **Ownership & Control:** Generally, preferred shareholders have **no voting rights**. They are owners, but they don't get a say in running the company.
* **Claim on Assets & Income:** They have priority over common shareholders. They get paid their fixed dividend *before* any dividends are paid to common stockholders. In a liquidation, they also get paid back before common shareholders.
* **Dividends:** Preferred shares usually pay a fixed dividend, much like a bond's coupon payment.
  * **Cumulative Preferred Shares:** This is a key feature! If the company skips a dividend payment, it accrues and must be paid in full before any common dividends can be paid. This is a huge protection for preferred investors.
  * **Non-Cumulative:** If a dividend is skipped, it's gone forever. Tough luck!

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.3 Special Features ‚öôÔ∏è</span>

Some equity securities come with extra bells and whistles:
* **Callable Shares:** The company has the right to buy back the shares from investors at a pre-specified call price. This is good for the company (if interest rates fall, they can "refinance" their equity) but bad for the investor. Callable shares are **less risky** for the company and **more risky** for the investor.
* **Putable Shares:** The shareholder has the right to sell the shares back to the company at a pre-specified price. This is good for the investor (it sets a price floor) but bad for the company. Putable shares are **more risky** for the company and **less risky** for the investor.
* **Convertible Preference Shares:** Allows shareholders to convert their preferred shares into a specified number of common shares. This gives investors the safety of a fixed dividend (upside protection) plus the potential to share in the company's growth if the common stock does well (upside participation).

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 2: Public vs. Private Equity: The Big Leagues vs. The Inner Circle üèüÔ∏è (LOS 42.b)</span>

* **Public Equity:** These are shares traded on public stock exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE). Anyone can buy them.
* **Private Equity:** These are shares of companies that are not publicly traded. They are typically held by the company's founders, management, or private investors.

| Feature | Public Equity (e.g., Tesla, HDFC Bank) | Private Equity (e.g., A start-up funded by Sequoia) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Liquidity** üíß | High; easy to buy and sell. | Low; very difficult to sell your stake. |
| **Regulation** üìú | Highly regulated; must disclose financials. | Lightly regulated; less disclosure required. |
| **Reporting Costs** üí∏ | High due to compliance. | Low. |
| **Investor Focus** ‚è≥ | Can be focused on short-term results (quarterly earnings). | Focused on long-term growth. |
| **Return Potential** üí∞ | Moderate. | Potentially very high, but with higher risk. |

Types of **Private Equity** investments include:
* **Venture Capital:** Funding for new, high-growth-potential startups.
* **Leveraged Buyouts (LBOs):** Using borrowed money to buy an entire company.
* **Private Investments in Public Equity (PIPEs):** A public company raising capital from private investors.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 3: Investing Beyond Borders üåè (LOS 42.c)</span>

Want to invest in a company outside your home country? Here's how:
* **Direct Investing:** Simply buy the foreign shares in the foreign market. This can be complex and expensive due to currency conversions and different regulations.
* **Depository Receipts (DRs):** This is the easy way! A bank buys shares of a foreign company, bundles them, and issues a security in a local market that represents those shares.
  * **American Depository Receipts (ADRs):** Traded in the U.S. A famous Indian example is the **Infosys ADR** traded on the NYSE.
  * **Global Depository Receipts (GDRs):** Traded in multiple countries, often in London or Luxembourg.
  * A **sponsored DR** is one where the company is involved and provides financial information to investors. An **unsponsored DR** is created by the bank without the company's involvement.

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

üí° CFA Exam Tip ‚úçÔ∏è: Depository Receipts simplify foreign investing by allowing you to trade in your local currency on a local exchange. However, you are still exposed to **currency risk**! If the foreign currency weakens against your home currency, the value of your DR will fall, all else being equal.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 4: Risk, Return, and the Role of Equity ‚öñÔ∏è (LOS 42.d)</span>

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">4.1 Sources of Return</span>
1.  **Price Appreciation (Capital Gains):** The stock price goes up.
2.  **Dividends:** Cash payments from the company to shareholders.
3.  **Currency Gains/Losses:** If you invest in a foreign stock, changes in the exchange rate will affect your total return.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">4.2 Risk Characteristics</span>
* **Common Stock** is the riskiest form of equity because shareholders are last in line for claims on assets and dividends are not guaranteed.
* **Preferred Stock** is less risky than common stock due to its fixed dividend and priority claim.
* **Putable shares** are less risky for the investor than non-putable shares.
* **Callable shares** are more risky for the investor than non-callable shares.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">4.3 Role of Equity in Financing</span>
Equity is a critical source of long-term capital for a company. It's used to fund long-term assets like factories and equipment, finance R&D, and make acquisitions. It signals financial stability to the market.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 5: Book Value vs. Market Value: The Accountant vs. The Investor üë©‚Äçüíº (LOS 42.e)</span>

This is a fundamental concept!
* **Book Value:** An accountant's view of the company. It's the value of assets minus liabilities on the balance sheet. **Book value** is a historical measure‚Äîit tells you what the company has done in the *past*.
* **Market Value:** An investor's view of the company. It's the current share price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding. **Market value** is a forward-looking measure‚Äîit reflects what investors expect the company to do in the *future*.

A company's primary goal is to generate a **Return on Equity (ROE)** that is higher than its **cost of equity**.
* **Return on Equity (ROE):** An accounting measure of profitability. It shows how much profit the company generates for every dollar of equity.
* **Cost of Equity:** The return that investors *require* to compensate them for the risk of investing in the company's stock.

If **ROE > Cost of Equity**, the company is creating value, and its market value will likely be higher than its book value. The **price-to-book ratio** (Market Value / Book Value) is a key metric used to gauge this.

### üéØ Quick Exam-Day Pointers

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

**Common vs. Preferred:**
  - **Common shares** have votes and variable dividends.
  - **Preferred shares** have no votes but fixed, priority dividends.
  - **Cumulative** is a key protective feature for preferred stock.

**Callable vs. Putable:**
  - **Callable** ‚Üí Benefits the company (more investor risk).
  - **Putable** ‚Üí Benefits the investor (less investor risk).

**Book Value is the Past, Market Value is the Future:**
  - **Book value** is a historical accounting number.
  - **Market value** is what investors think the company's future cash flows are worth.

**ROE is Key:**
  - A company creates value when its Return on Equity (ROE) is greater than its cost of equity.

**Depository Receipts (DRs):**
  - They are an easy way to get foreign stock exposure, but they **do not** eliminate currency risk.
