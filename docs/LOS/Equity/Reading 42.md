## Reading 42: Overview of Equity Securities 🏛️

### 🎯 Introduction

Welcome to the world of equity\! Think of this as your ownership manual. When you buy equity (like a stock), you're not just buying a piece of paper; you're buying a piece of a **business**. You become a part-owner, with a claim on the company's assets and future profits.

This reading is the bedrock for all of equity valuation. We'll break down the different *types* of equity, from plain-vanilla common stock to more complex preferred shares. We'll explore how to invest overseas and, critically, we'll hammer home the difference between a company's **accounting value (Book Value)** and its **market value (Price)**. Mastering this difference is the key to thinking like an analyst.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 1: The Building Blocks of Equity (LOS 42.a, 42.b, 42.c)</span>

Equity securities aren't one-size-fits-all. They come in different forms, each with unique rights and features.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.1 Common Stock: The "Standard" Share</span>

This is what most people think of as "stock." As a common shareholder, you are the **residual claimant**.

  * **Residual Claim:** This means you get what's left over. In a liquidation, all creditors (bondholders) and preferred shareholders get paid *first*. You get the "residue," or whatever remains. This makes it the riskiest position, but it also gives you **unlimited upside**—you get *all* the profits after everyone else is paid.
  * **Voting Rights:** You own the company, so you get to vote on major issues, like electing the board of directors.
  * **Voting Systems (LOS 42.b):**
      * **Statutory Voting:** You get one vote per share, per board seat. If you own 100 shares and there are 3 seats, you can cast 100 votes for a candidate in *each* election (100 for A, 100 for B, 100 for C). This system favors majority shareholders.
      * **Cumulative Voting:** You get one vote per share *times* the number of seats. You can pool all your votes onto one candidate. With 100 shares and 3 seats, you have 300 votes, and you can put all 300 on a single candidate. This system gives minority shareholders a better chance at representation.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.2 Preferred Stock: The Equity-Debt Hybrid</span>

Preferred stock (or preference shares) is a blend of debt and equity. It has features of both:

  * **Like Debt:** It pays a fixed dividend (like a bond's coupon) and typically has no voting rights.
  * **Like Equity:** Dividends are *not* a legal obligation (unlike bond interest). The company can miss a dividend payment without causing a default.

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

**💡 Key Types of Preferred Stock (LOS 42.a)**

  * **Cumulative:** This is a key feature\! If the company misses a dividend, it *accrues* and must be paid in full *before* any common stock dividend can be paid. Non-cumulative means "if it's missed, it's gone forever."
  * **Participating:** Gets an *extra* dividend beyond the stated amount if company profits exceed a certain level. This gives it some of the upside of common stock.
  * **Convertible:** Gives the owner the right to *convert* their preferred shares into a fixed number of common shares. This allows the investor to enjoy the stable dividends of preferred stock with the *option* to capture the upside of common stock if the company does well.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.3 Public vs. Private Equity (LOS 42.c)</span>

  * **Public Equity:** These are the shares you know, traded on exchanges like the NYSE or NASDAQ. They are liquid, regulated, and must provide detailed financial disclosures.
  * **Private Equity:** These shares are held by a limited number of investors and do *not* trade on a public exchange.
      * **Characteristics:** Less liquid, less disclosure, weaker corporate governance, but also less focus on short-term results.
      * **The Goal:** The goal for many private equity investors is to eventually take the company public (via an IPO) to get a large return.
      * **Main Types:**
        1.  **Venture Capital (VC):** Funding for early-stage, high-growth companies (start-ups).
        2.  **Leveraged Buyouts (LBOs):** Using a large amount of debt to buy all the outstanding stock of a public company, taking it private.
        3.  **Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE):** A private investment in a *public* company, often at a discount.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 2: Investing Globally & Risk vs. Return (LOS 42.d, 42.e, 42.f)</span>

Equity investing isn't limited to your home country. Here's how to access foreign markets and how to think about the risk.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.1 Investing in Non-Domestic Equities (LOS 42.d)</span>

How can you buy shares of, say, a Japanese company if you live in the U.S.?

1.  **Direct Investing:** The most direct way. You buy the foreign stock, in the foreign market, in the foreign currency. This can be complex and expensive.
2.  **Depository Receipts (DRs):** The most common way. A bank buys shares of the foreign company, holds them in custody, and then issues "receipts" that trade on a local exchange.
      * **ADR (American Depository Receipt):** Trades in the U.S. (in USD).
      * **GDR (Global Depository Receipt):** Issued outside the U.S. *and* the issuer's home country. Often traded in London or Luxembourg.
      * **Sponsored vs. Unsponsored:** A **sponsored** DR is one the company is actively involved in (provides investor voting rights, more disclosure). An unsponsored DR is one the bank issues without the company's involvement (the bank keeps the voting rights).
3.  **Global Registered Shares (GRS):** A single share that trades on multiple exchanges around the world in different currencies.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.2 Risk and Return Characteristics (LOS 42.e)</span>

  * **Sources of Return:** Your total return from equity comes from three places:
    1.  Price appreciation (capital gain).
    2.  Dividends.
    3.  **Gains or losses from currency exchange** (if it's a foreign stock).
  * **Risk:**
      * **Common stock** is the *riskiest* equity, as it's the residual claimant.
      * **Preferred stock** is *less risky* than common because its dividend is fixed and it gets paid first.
      * **Putable Shares** (which let the *shareholder* sell back to the company at a fixed price) are the *least* risky.
      * **Callable Shares** (which let the *company* buy back from the shareholder at a fixed price) are the *most* risky (from the investor's view), as the company will "call" them away right when they become most valuable.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.3 Role of Equity in Financing (LOS 42.f)</span>

Why do companies issue equity at all?

1.  **To Finance Assets:** It's a primary source of capital to buy productive assets (factories, machines) and fund growth.
2.  **Liquidity:** Having publicly traded shares provides liquidity for the firm, which can be important for raising additional funds or for providing employee compensation (stock options).

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 3: Value vs. Price (LOS 42.g, 42.h)</span>

This is the most critical concept in this reading. **Book value is *not* market value.**

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">3.1 Book Value vs. Market Value (LOS 42.g)</span>

  * **Book Value of Equity:** An *accounting* concept.
      * `Book Value = Total Assets - Total Liabilities`
      * It reflects the firm's **past** operations. It's the cumulative result of all past profits (via retained earnings) and financing decisions. It is backward-looking.
  * **Market Value of Equity:** A *finance* concept.
      * `Market Value = Current Share Price × Number of Shares Outstanding`
      * It reflects investors' **future** expectations. It's the market's consensus on the *present value of all future cash flows*. It is forward-looking.

An analyst's job is to compare these two. The **Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio** does this directly. A high P/B ratio (e.g., a "growth stock") means investors expect the company to generate future profits far in excess of its accounting value.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">3.2 ROE vs. Cost of Equity (LOS 42.h)</span>

These are two different "returns" that are often confused.

  * **Return on Equity (ROE):** An *accounting* measure of *past* performance.
      * `ROE = Net Income / Average Book Value of Equity`
      * It tells you what return management **generated** on the company's accounting equity.
  * **Cost of Equity (k_e):** An *investor* concept.
      * It is the **required rate of return** an investor demands to compensate them for the risk of holding the stock.
      * It is a *minimum* return threshold. If a company's ROE is consistently *higher* than its cost of equity, it is creating value. If its ROE is *lower* than its cost of equity, it is destroying value.

### 🎯 Quick Exam-Day Pointers

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

  * **Common Stock = Residual Claimant:** You get what's left. High risk, high reward.
  * **Cumulative vs. Statutory Voting:** Cumulative voting helps minority shareholders.
  * **Cumulative Preferred Stock:** Missed dividends *must* be paid before common dividends can be. This is a crucial feature.
  * **ADRs:** Know that these are the most common way to invest in foreign stocks. A **sponsored** ADR is better for investors (more rights, more disclosure).
  * **Risk Ranking (Lowest to Highest):** Putable Shares < Preferred Stock < Common Stock < Callable Shares.
  * **Book Value ≠ Market Value:** This is the big one. **Book value is accounting (past)**. **Market value is finance (future expectations)**.
  * **ROE vs. Cost of Equity:** **ROE is what the company *did* (accounting)**. **Cost of Equity is what investors *require* (finance)**. A company creates value when `ROE > Cost of Equity`.
