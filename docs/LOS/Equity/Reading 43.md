## Reading 43: Company Analysis: Past and Present 🚀

### 🎯 Introduction
Think of yourself as a financial detective 🕵️‍♀️. Before you can predict a company's future and decide if its stock is a good buy, you need to understand its story—its past actions and its current situation. A company research report is your case file. This reading teaches you how to assemble and analyze that file, starting with the company's fundamental game plan (**business model**), digging into its revenue and costs, and finally examining how it finances its operations. It's all about connecting the dots between a company's strategy and the numbers it reports.

### Part 1: The Analyst's Dossier: The Company Research Report 📂

A thorough **company research report** is the final output of your analysis. It's a comprehensive document that lays out your valuation and investment recommendation.

An **initial report** (when an analyst starts "initiating coverage") is typically very detailed.

| Key Elements of an Initial Research Report | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Recommendation & Price Target** 🎯 | The final call: Buy, Hold, or Sell, with a specific target price. |
| **Company Description** 🏢 | What does the company *do*? Explains its business model, products, and strategy. |
| **Industry Overview** 🏭 | How does the company stack up against its competitors? This includes market share and competitive positioning. |
| **Financial Analysis** 📊 | A deep dive into historical results, including revenues, costs, and capital structure. |
| **Valuation** 💰 | The heart of the report, showing the models used (e.g., DCF, multiples) and the assumptions made to arrive at the intrinsic value. |
| **ESG Factors** 🌱 | Analysis of Environmental, Social, and Governance risks and opportunities. |
| **Risks** ⚠️ | What could go wrong? Discusses the key risks that could impact the valuation. |

**Follow-up reports** are usually shorter, focusing on updates like recent earnings results or new information that changes the initial recommendation.

### Part 2: What's the Company's Game Plan? The Business Model 🗺️

A company's **business model** is its blueprint for making money. Understanding it is the first step in any analysis because it highlights the key **revenue drivers** and cost structures. To determine the business model, you need to answer five key questions:

1.  **Products/Services?** 📦 What are they selling?
2.  **Customers?** 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Who are they selling to?
3.  **Sales Channels?** 🛒 How do they reach their customers (online, retail stores, direct sales)?
4.  **Pricing & Payment?** 💳 How do they set prices and collect money?
5.  **Suppliers?** 🚚 Who are their key partners and suppliers?

> **Example 🌍**
> **Apple's Business Model:**
> * **Products:** Sells premium hardware (iPhone, Mac) and services (App Store, Apple Music).
> * **Customers:** Targets consumers who value design, user experience, and a strong brand ecosystem.
> * **Channels:** Sells through its own retail stores, website, and third-party retailers.
> * **Pricing:** Uses a premium pricing strategy due to its strong brand loyalty.
> * **Suppliers:** Relies on a global supply chain (e.g., Foxconn in Asia for manufacturing).

### Part 3: Show Me the Money! Analyzing Revenue & Pricing Power 💰

Revenue is the lifeblood of a company. Analysts use two main approaches to evaluate it:

#### **Top-Down Analysis**

A **top-down analysis** starts with the big picture (the macro-economy) and drills down to the company.

* **How it Works:** You start with a forecast for the overall economy (like GDP growth), then forecast the growth of the industry, and finally estimate the company's **market share** within that industry to project its revenue.
* **Example:** Forecasting revenue for an Indian car company like Maruti Suzuki. You'd start with India's expected GDP growth, then forecast the growth of the passenger vehicle market, and finally estimate Maruti Suzuki's share of that market.

#### **Bottom-Up Analysis**

A **bottom-up analysis** starts with the company's individual segments and builds up to a total revenue forecast.

* **How it Works:** You forecast revenue for each product line, business unit, or geographic region, and then sum them up. This often involves forecasting volume (how many units are sold) and price (the average selling price).
* **Example:** To forecast Nike's revenue, you could forecast sales for its footwear, apparel, and equipment divisions separately, and then for different regions like North America, Europe, and Asia.

A key factor in revenue analysis is **pricing power**. This is a company's ability to raise prices without losing significant sales. Companies with strong brands (Apple), unique products (a patented drug), or high customer switching costs have high pricing power. High and stable profit margins are often a sign of strong pricing power.

### Part 4: From Sales to Profits: Analyzing Costs & Operating Profitability 🏭

Once you've analyzed revenue, the next step is to understand costs.

#### Operating Leverage
Operating costs can be **variable** (change with sales volume, like raw materials) or **fixed** (stay the same regardless of sales, like rent). The mix of these costs creates operating leverage.

The **degree of operating leverage (DOL)** measures how much a company's operating profit changes for a 1% change in sales.

$DOL = \frac{\% \Delta \text{Operating Profit}}{\% \Delta \text{Sales}} = \frac{Q \times (P-VC)}{Q \times (P-VC) - FC}$

* A high DOL means a company has high fixed costs. This is a double-edged sword ⚔️: a small increase in sales leads to a huge jump in profits, but a small decrease in sales leads to a huge drop in profits. High DOL means high **business risk**.

#### Economies of Scale & Scope
* **Economies of Scale:** When producing more units leads to a lower cost per unit (e.g., a large factory is more efficient than a small one).
* **Economies of Scope:** When producing a variety of related products is cheaper than producing each one separately (e.g., a bank offering both loans and insurance can share marketing costs).

#### Working Capital
Analyzing working capital tells you how efficiently a company is managing its day-to-day cash flow. The key metric is the **cash conversion cycle (CCC)**.

$CCC = \text{Days of Inventory on Hand} + \text{Days of Sales Outstanding} - \text{Number of Days of Payables}$

A shorter CCC is better, as it means the company ties up less cash in its operations. Some companies, like Amazon or Walmart, have a *negative* CCC, which is fantastic! It means they sell their inventory and collect cash from customers *before* they have to pay their suppliers.

### Part 5: Fueling the Engine: Analyzing Capital Investments & Structure ⚙️

#### Capital Structure & Financial Leverage
How does a company pay for its assets? With debt or equity? This is its **capital structure**. Using debt creates financial leverage.

The **degree of financial leverage (DFL)** measures how much a company's net income changes for a 1% change in operating profit.

$DFL = \frac{\% \Delta \text{Net Income}}{\% \Delta \text{Operating Profit}} = \frac{EBIT}{EBIT - \text{Interest}}$

* A high DFL means the company uses a lot of debt. This magnifies returns to shareholders (higher ROE) but also increases the risk of bankruptcy. High DFL means high **financial risk**.

#### Unlevered vs. Levered Returns
* **Unlevered Returns** (e.g., **ROA**, **ROIC**) measure profitability before considering the effect of debt.
* **Levered Returns** (e.g., **ROE**) measure profitability for equity shareholders *after* accounting for debt. Comparing them shows the impact of leverage on shareholder returns.

> [!TIP]
> **CFA Exam Tip ✍️:** Be prepared to calculate and interpret DOL and DFL. Remember:
> * DOL is about **fixed operating costs** (like rent and machinery).
> * DFL is about **fixed financing costs** (interest on debt).
> * Total Leverage = DOL × DFL

***

### 🧪 Formula Summary

* **Contribution Margin (CM):**
    $CM = \text{Price} - \text{Variable Cost per unit}$
* **Operating Profit:**
    $\text{Operating Profit} = (Q \times CM) - \text{Fixed Costs}$
* **Degree of Operating Leverage (DOL):**
    $DOL = \frac{Q \times (P-VC)}{Q \times (P-VC) - FC}$
* **Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC):**
    $CCC = DOH + DSO - \text{Days of Payables}$
* **Degree of Financial Leverage (DFL):**
    $DFL = \frac{EBIT}{EBIT - \text{Interest}}$

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### 🎯 Quick Exam-Day Pointers
> * **Start with the Business Model:** Before touching any numbers, understand what the company sells, who it sells to, and how it operates.
> * **Revenue is King, but Pricing Power is the Crown:** Look beyond simple revenue growth. A company that can raise prices without losing customers (high pricing power) has a strong competitive advantage.
> * **Leverage Magnifies Everything:** High **Operating Leverage (DOL)** magnifies the effect of sales changes on operating profit. High **Financial Leverage (DFL)** magnifies the effect of operating profit changes on net income. Both increase risk.
> * **Watch the Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC):** A shortening CCC is a sign of improving efficiency. A negative CCC is a sign of a very strong business model.
> * **Compare, Compare, Compare:** A company's ratios are meaningless in isolation. Always compare them to the company's own historical trends and to its industry peers.
