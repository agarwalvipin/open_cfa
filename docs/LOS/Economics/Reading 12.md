### Reading 12 ‚Äì *Firms and Market Structures*

*(Economics Topic, CFA Level I)*

Below you‚Äôll find a **LOS-by-LOS explainer** that first anchors each learning outcome (LOS) in plain language, then walks through the concept with **Indian-flavoured, real-world illustrations**, followed by **exam-smart pointers** (‚ö°), **common traps** (‚ùó) and **memory hacks**.

> **Tip for use:** treat this as a set of annotated notes‚Äîskim the *big-idea* sentence first, then drill into the bullets when you review, and finally test yourself with the ‚Äúquick pointer‚Äù section at the end.

## LOS 12.a  Breakeven & Shutdown; Economies / Diseconomies of Scale&#x20;

| Core idea                                                                                                   | Indian illustration                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Breakeven (TR = TC):** the output level where economic profit is zero.                                    | A new **Chai-on-Wheels** startup in Bengaluru must **sell ‚âà 700 cups/day** to cover rent, wages, fuel. Below that, it‚Äôs earning <br>normal profit only.        |
| **Shutdown point (TR < TVC):** minimum price necessary to keep producing in the short-run.                  | During the first Covid wave, many **small textile looms in Tiruppur** halted because market price for T-shirts < their average variable cost (cotton + power). |
| **Economies of scale:** LRAC falls as output rises (specialisation, bulk purchasing, spreading fixed R\&D). | **Reliance Jio** slashed data prices once tower network scaled, pushing LRAC sharply lower.                                                                    |
| **Diseconomies:** LRAC rises after a point (bureaucracy, coordination drag).                                | Some PSU steel plants saw costs creep up after capacity expansions beyond optimal scale‚Äîmaintenance complexity offset size benefit.                            |

**‚ö° Exam pointers**

* Breakeven uses *average total cost*; shutdown uses *average variable cost*. Mis-labelling these is a classic trap.
* Graph questions often hide the shutdown point‚Äîtrace MC = AVC minimum.

## LOS 12.b  Characteristics of Perfect Competition, Monopolistic Competition, Oligopoly & Monopoly&#x20;

| Structure                | # Firms              | Product type   | Pricing power                                | Barriers    | Indian lens                                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Perfect competition      | **Many**             | Homogeneous    | None (price-taker)                           | Nil         | *Unpolished rice* markets in Telangana mandis.                                                          |
| Monopolistic competition | Many                 | Differentiated | **Some** (branding)                          | Low         | *Urban caf√©s*‚ÄîBlue Tokai vs Third Wave vs Starbucks.                                                    |
| Oligopoly                | Few, inter-dependent | Either         | **Strategic** (game-theory)                  | Medium‚Äìhigh | **Indian telecom trio** Jio, Airtel, Vi‚Äîprice cuts & spectrum auctions resemble Cournot/Bertrand games. |
| Monopoly                 | Single               | Unique         | **Full**, constrained by demand & regulation | High        | Indian Railways (passenger) or Municipal water boards.                                                  |

**‚ö° Exam pointers**

* Know **profit-max rule** (MR = MC) *across* all structures; only perfect competition has P = MR = MC.
* In MC firms, LR economic profit ‚Üí 0 because of free entry.

## LOS 12.c  Supply‚ÄìDemand & Pricing Under Monopolistic Competition&#x20;

1. **Short-run:** MC firm sets Q\* where MR = MC and reads price off **down-sloping** demand curve ‚áí possible super-normal profit.
2. **Long-run:** New caf√©s enter until **demand curve shifts left / flattens** and just touches ATC ‚áí only normal profit.
3. **Pricing strategies:** Heavy use of **non-price competition**‚Äîe.g., **Cafe Coffee Day** loyalty cards, ambiance, seasonal frappes.

**‚ùó Trap:** Many candidates confuse LR outcome with perfect competition. Remember: **MC firms still face downward-sloping demand** ‚áí price > MC even in LR.

## LOS 12.d  Supply‚ÄìDemand & Pricing Under Oligopoly&#x20;

| Model                  | Key assumption                    | Implication                              | India example                                                   |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cournot (quantity)** | Rival holds output constant       | Firms split market; price above PC level | Cement cartels allegations‚ÄîACC vs Ultratech.                    |
| **Bertrand (price)**   | Rival holds price constant        | Drives P‚ÜíMC with two identical firms     | Rare; maybe airline flash-fare wars on Delhi-Mumbai route.      |
| **Stackelberg**        | One leader sets Q first           | First-mover gets larger share            | Jio‚Äôs aggressive data bundles set quantity tone; others follow. |
| **Kinked demand**      | Rivals match price cuts not hikes | Creates price-rigidity zone              | Petrol pump dealers reluctant to hike local price discounts.    |

**‚ö° How they test you:** small payoff matrices‚Äîidentify dominant strategy or Nash equilibrium quickly.

## LOS 12.e  Identify Market Structure & Use / Limits of Concentration Measures&#x20;

1. **Four-firm concentration ratio (CR‚ÇÑ):** share of top 4 firms. Easy but ignores distribution beyond top four.
2. **Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI):** Œ£ (s·µ¢¬≤).

   * HHI < 1500 ‚Üí competitive; 1500‚Äì2500 ‚Üí moderate; > 2500 ‚Üí concentrated (US DOJ guidelines).
3. **Limits:**

   * Doesn‚Äôt capture **global vs local** scope (e.g., app-based cab booking is global oligopoly but local duopoly).
   * High CR‚ÇÑ can still be competitive if threat of **entry** (contestable markets).
4. **Indian context:** HHI in Indian **paint industry** (Asian Paints \~40%, Berger \~13%, Kansai \~12%, Akzo \~4%) sits near 2000‚Äîmoderately concentrated yet pricing competition persists due to new entrants (Indigo Paints).

**‚ö° Exam pointers**

* They love asking: ‚ÄúHHI rises from 1800 to 2600 after merger‚Äîwhat does regulator do?‚Äù Answer: likely challenge/ block unless divestitures.

## **Formula Sheet ‚Äì Reading 12**

| Concept                              | Formula                           |   |   |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | - | - |
| **Shutdown price**                   | P = minimum **AVC**               |   |   |
| **Breakeven price**                  | P = minimum **ATC**               |   |   |
| **Marginal revenue (linear demand)** | MR = P (1 ‚Äì 1/                    | Œµ | ) |
| **Lerner Index (market power)**      | (P ‚Äì MC) / P = ‚Äì1 / Œµ             |   |   |
| **HHI**                              | Œ£ (s·µ¢¬≤) where s·µ¢ = market-share % |   |   |

*(Memorise Lerner & HHI‚Äîeasy marks!)*

## **Quick Exam-Day Pointer üìù**

> **‚ÄúSketch first, solve second.‚Äù**
> Before crunching numbers, **draw the cost & revenue curves** (or a quick payoff matrix). A 15-second sketch locks the logic, exposes which curve or quantity the question hides, and prevents sign errors‚Äîespecially for shutdown vs breakeven, or MR‚ÄìMC intersections.

### Final Take-away

* **Think stories, not just curves.** Link each structure to an Indian sector you read in the business news.
* Drill **definitions** (shutdown, breakeven, Lerner) because Level I items sets often ask ‚Äú*most likely / least likely*‚Äù conceptual twists.
* Practice a few **HHI calculations** on your BA II Plus to gain speed.

Stay curious‚Äîsee the theory play out in the chai stall, the telecom ad war, or your cab fare surge, and the models will stick long after exam day.
