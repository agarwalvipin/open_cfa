## Reading 12: Firms and Market Structures

### 🎯 Introduction

Welcome, future charterholder! Imagine you're walking through a giant shopping mall. In the food court, you see a dozen different stalls selling almost identical biryani—that's **perfect competition**. A little further, you see a row of cafes; they all sell coffee, but each has a unique vibe and flavor—that's **monopolistic competition**. On the top floor, there are only two or three massive electronics stores, like Croma and Reliance Digital, watching each other's every move—that's an **oligopoly**. And finally, the mall itself is powered by a single electric company—a **monopoly**.

This reading is your map of that mall. We'll explore these four **market structures**, understand how firms in each one decide what to produce and what price to charge, and learn how to identify where a company fits in this competitive landscape.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 1: To Sell or To Shut Down? - The Rules of Survival (LOS 12.a)</span>

Every business, regardless of its market, faces two critical questions:

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.1 Breakeven and Shutdown Rules</span>

| Condition | In Simple Terms... | The Decision |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TR = TC** | Your total revenue exactly covers all your costs (fixed + variable). | You're at the **breakeven point**. You're making zero economic profit. |
| **TC > TR > TVC** | You're losing money, but your revenue is still more than your variable costs (like ingredients and hourly wages). | **Operate in the short run.** You're covering all your variable costs and *some* of your fixed costs (like rent). Shutting down would mean losing *all* your fixed costs. |
| **TR < TVC** | Your revenue isn't even enough to cover your day-to-day variable costs. | **Shut down immediately!** 🛑 You're losing money on every single unit you sell, on top of losing all your fixed costs. |

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

**💡 CFA Exam Tip ✍️:** Remember the short-run shutdown rule: **Price < Average Variable Cost (AVC)** or **Total Revenue < Total Variable Cost (TVC)**. If you can't even cover your per-unit variable costs, it's time to close up shop for now. This is a very testable concept.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.2 Economies and Diseconomies of Scale</span>

In the **long run**, all costs are variable. A firm can change its factory size.
* **Economies of Scale:** When a firm gets bigger, its long-run average total cost (LRATC) per unit goes down. Think of a massive car plant like Maruti Suzuki in India; mass production makes each car cheaper to build.
* **Diseconomies of Scale:** After a certain point, a firm can get *too* big. Bureaucracy and communication problems creep in, and the LRATC per unit starts to rise.
* **Minimum Efficient Scale:** This is the sweet spot—the plant size that produces at the lowest possible long-run average cost.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 2: The Four Arenas of Competition 🏟️ (LOS 12.b)</span>

Every firm competes in one of four market structures. This table is your ultimate cheat sheet.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.1 Market Structure Comparison</span>

| Feature | Perfect Competition | Monopolistic Competition | Oligopoly | Monopoly |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Number of Sellers** | Very Many | Many | A Few | One |
| **Product Type** | Homogeneous (Identical) | Differentiated | Identical or Differentiated | Unique |
| **Barriers to Entry** | Very Low | Low | High | Very High (Often gov't protected) |
| **Pricing Power** | None (Price Taker) | Some | Significant | Considerable |
| **Example** | Farmers' market for wheat 🌾 | Restaurants, Cafes ☕ | Telecom (Jio, Airtel, Vi) 📱 | Indian Railways (historically) 🚆 |

-----

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 3: Monopolistic Competition - Many Choices, Small Differences ☕ (LOS 12.c)</span>

This is one of the most common market structures. Think of the restaurant scene in Mumbai or the global market for shampoo.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">3.1 Key Features</span>

* **A large number of firms, slightly differentiated products, and low barriers to entry.**
* **The Power of Branding:** Because products are different (in reality or just in perception), firms have some pricing power and face a downward-sloping demand curve. They compete heavily on advertising, branding, and quality.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">3.2 Short-Run vs. Long-Run</span>

* **Short Run:** A firm can earn an economic profit if its product is popular (Price > ATC).
* **Long Run:** These profits attract new competitors. As new firms enter, the demand for the original firm's product falls. New firms will keep entering until all economic profits are gone, and **Price = ATC**. In the long run, firms in this market make **zero economic profit**.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 4: Oligopoly - The Game of Titans ♟️ (LOS 12.d)</span>

This market is defined by one word: **interdependence**. With only a few large players (like Boeing and Airbus in the large jet market, or Jio and Airtel in Indian telecom), each firm's decision has a huge impact on the others. It's like a high-stakes chess match.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">4.1 Models of Oligopoly Behavior</span>

Because firms are interdependent, we need different models to predict their behavior.

* **Kinked Demand Curve Model:** Assumes competitors will **follow a price cut** but **ignore a price increase**. This creates a "kink" in the demand curve and explains why prices in an oligopoly can be very stable.
* **Cournot Model:** Each firm assumes its rivals' output is fixed and chooses its own profit-maximizing output level. In the end, they share the market.
* **Nash Equilibrium (Game Theory):** A situation where no single player can do better by changing their own strategy, given what the other players are doing. Often, the Nash equilibrium for oligopolies is for all firms to charge a lower price and make less profit than they could if they all colluded. Cheating on a collusive agreement is often the dominant strategy.
* **Dominant Firm Model:** One firm is so big and efficient (the "dominant firm") that it effectively sets the market price. The smaller firms ("fringe firms") act as price-takers at that price. Think of De Beers in the diamond market for many years.

* **Collusion:** When firms in an oligopoly secretly agree to act like a monopoly (e.g., by fixing prices high), it's called **collusion**. This is illegal in most countries. Such agreements are more likely to be successful when there are few firms, products are similar, and cost structures are alike.

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

**💡 CFA Exam Tip ✍️:** For oligopoly, **interdependence** is the keyword. The exam will test your understanding of the strategic decision-making involved. Be familiar with the logic of the **Nash equilibrium** and why collusion is tempting but difficult to maintain.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 5: Identifying Market Structures - The Detective Work 🕵️‍♀️ (LOS 12.e)</span>

How can an analyst tell what kind of market a company operates in? You can look at the characteristics in the table above, but you can also use quantitative measures of **market concentration**.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">5.1 Market Concentration Measures</span>

* **N-Firm Concentration Ratio:** The simplest measure. It's the sum of the market shares of the largest 'N' firms in an industry (e.g., the 4-firm ratio).
  * A ratio close to 0 suggests perfect competition.
  * A ratio between 0 and 50 suggests monopolistic competition.
  * A ratio above 50 suggests an oligopoly.
  * A ratio of 100 is a monopoly.

* **Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI):** A more sensitive measure. It's the sum of the *squares* of the market shares of all firms in the industry.
  * HHI gives more weight to the largest firms.
  * A very low HHI (e.g., < 100) is a competitive market.
  * A high HHI (e.g., > 2,500) is a highly concentrated market.
  * Regulators like the U.S. Department of Justice use HHI to evaluate the impact of potential mergers.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">5.2 Limitations of Concentration Measures</span>

* They don't account for **barriers to entry**. A market could have a high HHI, but if barriers to entry are low, the threat of potential competition can keep prices down.
* Defining the geographic market can be tricky. Is the market local, national, or global?

-----

### <span style="color: #00838F;">5.3 Global & Local Context 🌍</span>

* **Global Example:** U.S. telecom market is a classic oligopoly, with AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile controlling most of the market. Regulators use HHI to monitor mergers.
* **Indian Example:** The Indian telecom sector saw a shift from many players to a few dominant ones (Jio, Airtel, Vi), increasing market concentration and changing competitive dynamics.

### 🧪 Formula Summary

<div style="background-color: #F5F5F5; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;">

**N-Firm Concentration Ratio:** 

$$\text{Sum of market shares of the largest N firms}$$

</div>

<div style="background-color: #F5F5F5; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;">

**Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI):** 

$$HHI = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\text{Market Share}_i)^2$$

*(Note: Market share should be expressed as a whole number, e.g., 30% is 30, not 0.30)*

### 🎯 Quick Exam-Day Pointers

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

* **Shutdown Rule:** 
  * **Short Run:** Shut down if **Price < AVC**.
  * **Long Run:** Exit if **Price < ATC**.
* **Zero Economic Profit:** In the long run, firms in **perfect competition** and **monopolistic competition** earn zero economic profit due to low barriers to entry.
* **Interdependence is Oligopoly:** If a question describes firms strategically reacting to each other's decisions, you are in an oligopoly.
* **Concentration Ratios:** Know how to calculate both the N-firm ratio and HHI. Remember that **HHI is more sensitive** to mergers of large firms.
* **Profit Maximization Rule:** For all market structures, firms produce at the quantity where **Marginal Revenue (MR) = Marginal Cost (MC)**. The key difference is how price relates to MR.
