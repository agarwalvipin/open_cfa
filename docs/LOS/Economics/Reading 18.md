## Reading 18 — Capital Flows & the Foreign-Exchange (-FX-) Market

*(Economics Topic Area | CFA Level I)*

Below is your **LOS-by-LOS roadmap** for Reading 18, laced with Indian-market illustrations, CFA exam hacks, and can’t-miss highlights.

### LOS 18.a Describe the FX market, key players, nominal vs real rates, & calculate % moves 

| What?                             | Quick drill-down                                                                                                                                   | India-centric hook                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Functions**                     | Facilitates *trade* (importers/exporters) **and** *capital* flows (FDI, FPI). Risk mgmt via forwards & swaps.                                      | Reliance Industries hedging \$ crude imports; FPIs routing ₹ flows via custodial banks.                             |
| **Sell-side vs buy-side**         | *Sell-side* = large global & Indian banks quoting two-way prices; *buy-side* = corps, mutual funds, hedge funds, RBI, tourists                     | SBI, HDFC Bank → sell-side; EPFO or a sovereign wealth fund → buy-side.                                             |
| **Quotes**                        | Always “price / base” e.g., 83 INR/USD means ₹83 per dollar — USD is base, INR price. Direct for a rupee-based trader, indirect for a U.S. trader. | Remember last-minute mantra: *“Base at the Bottom.”*                                                                |
| **Nominal vs real**               | Real P/B = Nominal P/B × (CPI\_P / CPI\_B)                                                                                                         | Post-COVID, ₹ nominally flat v. USD, but India’s CPI>U.S. → real INR *depreciated*, exporters gain competitiveness. |
| **% appreciation / depreciation** | %Δ base = (New / Old – 1). Flip & recalc for price-currency moves                                                                                  | If USD/INR drops from 83→81, INR *appreciates* ≈ 2.5 %; don’t call it a 2.5 % USD depreciation—re-invert first!     |

> **Exam tip:** Item sets love to trap you with quote inversions—write the *two-step* on scratch: 1️⃣ invert; 2️⃣ %Δ.

### LOS 18.b Classify exchange-rate regimes & link FX swings to trade & capital flows 

| IMF label (headline)              | Policy leeway               | Memory cue                     | Indian parallel               |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| **Formal dollarization**          | Nil – uses foreign currency | 🇵🇦 Panama uses USD           | N/A                           |
| **Monetary union**                | Joint CB                    | 🇪🇺 Eurozone                  | N/A                           |
| **Currency board**                | 1:1 hard peg                | 🇭🇰 HKD-USD                   | 1990s Nepal to INR mini-board |
| **Conventional fixed peg (±1 %)** | Limited                     | Gulf riyal-USD                 | 1948-1975 INR-GBP             |
| **Target / horizontal bands**     | Wider ±2–5 %                | Denmark-euro ERM II            | N/A                           |
| **Crawling peg / bands**          | Pre-announced step-ups      | LatAm “tablitas”               | 1960s-70s INR peg adjustments |
| **Managed float**                 | Discretionary intervention  | RBI “leaning against the wind” | *Current* Indian regime       |
| **Independent float**             | Pure market                 | AUD, CAD                       | N/A                           |

**Trade & capital flow impact**

* **Depreciating currency:** boosts exports (think IT services billing in USD) but inflates import bill (oil).
* **Appreciating currency:** attracts portfolio inflows chasing higher INR returns, but can widen current-account deficit by making imports cheaper.
* **Fixed or tightly-pegged regimes:** need FX-reserve buffers; large, sudden capital outflows can force devaluations (1991 India BOP crisis).

> **Exam nugget:** Balance-of-payments identity: *(X – M) + (S – I) + (T – G) = 0* – so a wider trade deficit must be financed by a bigger capital-account surplus .

### LOS 18.c Explain why governments slap capital-flow restrictions 

**Four classic motives**

1. **Tamp asset-price volatility** – limit hot-money exits (RBI’s 2013 FCNR-B swap scheme to stem rupee rout).
2. **Defend a fixed or soft-peg** – China’s capital controls help uphold the RMB basket peg.
3. **Keep domestic rates low / pursue independent monetary policy** – Indonesia’s bond-tax on foreigners, or India’s historical ceilings on ECB borrowings.
4. **Shield strategic sectors** – India caps FDI in defence at 74 % automatic, 100 % gov-route.

> **CFA kicker:** Short-term welfare gains (stability) vs long-term efficiency losses—expect a conceptual question on this trade-off.

## 📑 Formula Sheet – Reading 18

| Topic                               | Formula                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Real exchange rate**              | $R_{P/B} = E_{P/B} \times \dfrac{\text{CPI}_P}{\text{CPI}_B}$ (E = nominal rate)      |
| **% change in base-currency value** | $\%\Delta = \frac{\text{New}}{\text{Old}} - 1$ then *invert* for price-currency move  |
| **BOP identity (intuition)**        | $(X-M) = (S-I) + (T-G)$ → trade gap = net capital inflow need                         |

*(No heavy math here—master quote mechanics & regime taxonomy.)*

## 🚀 Quick Exam-Day Pointers

1. **Base vs price**: write “83 INR/USD → USD base” on paper the moment you sit.
2. **%Δ trap**: never say *currency A* appreciated by the same % that *currency B* depreciated—must invert.
3. **Regime ladder**: “Board < Fixed < Band < Crawl < Managed < Float”.
4. **Sell-side banks** vs *real-money accounts*—know which sits where.
5. **Capital controls** question? Pick “reduce volatility” unless another explicit goal is quoted.
6. Speed-boost: jot real-rate formula & IMF regime list on scratch before tackling Econ item set.
