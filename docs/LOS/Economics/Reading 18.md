## üöÄ Reading 18: Capital Flows and the FX Market

### üéØ Introduction

Welcome, future charterholder\! Imagine a massive, 24/7 global bazaar where instead of spices and silks, traders are buying and selling currencies: US dollars, Indian rupees, euros, and Japanese yen. This is the **foreign exchange (FX) market**, the largest and most liquid market in the world. üåç

Why does this market exist? Because an Indian company that wants to buy German machinery needs euros, and a Japanese tourist visiting the Taj Mahal needs rupees. This reading is your passport to this global bazaar. You'll learn how currency prices (**exchange rates**) are quoted, what rules countries follow to manage their currencies, and how the flow of money for trade and investment shapes the global economic landscape.

### Part 1: Welcome to the FX Bazaar üí∞

The **foreign exchange market** is where currencies are traded. Its participants range from giant corporations and investment funds to central banks and individual tourists.

**Key Participants:**

  * **Corporations:** Buy and sell foreign goods, requiring currency exchange.
  * **Investment Accounts:**
      * **Real money accounts** (like mutual funds) invest directly in foreign stocks and bonds.
      * **Leveraged accounts** (like hedge funds) speculate on currency movements using derivatives.
  * **Governments & Central Banks:** Intervene in the market to manage their currency's value.
  * **Retail Market:** Individuals trading for tourism or small-scale speculation.

#### **Nominal vs. Real Exchange Rates**

1.  **Nominal Exchange Rate:** This is the rate you see on the news. It's the straightforward price of one currency in terms of another.

      * Example: A quote of `USD/EUR 1.42` means 1 euro costs 1.42 US dollars. Here, the **EUR** is the **base currency** and the **USD** is the **price currency**.

2.  **Real Exchange Rate:** This tells the real story about purchasing power. It's the nominal rate adjusted for inflation in both countries. It answers the question: "How many baskets of Indian goods can I buy for one basket of American goods?"

**The Formula:**
$$\text{Real Exchange Rate} = S \times \left( \frac{CPI_f}{CPI_d} \right)$$
Where:

  * $S$ is the nominal spot rate (domestic/foreign).
  * $CPI_f$ is the Consumer Price Index of the foreign country.
  * $CPI_d$ is the Consumer Price Index of the domestic country.

##### **Example üßÆ**

Let's say the nominal exchange rate is `USD/GBP 1.70`. The US CPI is 110, and the UK CPI is 112. The base period real rate was 1.0.

$$\text{Real Exchange Rate}_{\frac{USD}{GBP}} = 1.70 \times \left( \frac{112}{110} \right) = 1.73$$

An increase in the real exchange rate means that the purchasing power of the base currency (GBP) has increased in terms of the price currency's (USD) goods.

#### **Calculating Currency Appreciation and Depreciation**

A change in the exchange rate means one currency got stronger (**appreciated**) and the other got weaker (**depreciated**).

**Example:**
The `USD/EUR` exchange rate moves from 1.42 to 1.39.

  * **For the EUR (the base currency):** It now costs fewer dollars to buy one euro. So, the euro has **depreciated**.
      * Percentage change = (1.39 / 1.42) - 1 = **-2.11%**.
  * **For the USD (the price currency):** We need to flip the quotes to `EUR/USD`.
      * Start: 1 / 1.42 = 0.7042 EUR/USD
      * End: 1 / 1.39 = 0.7194 EUR/USD
      * It now costs more euros to buy one dollar. The dollar has **appreciated**.
      * Percentage change = (0.7194 / 0.7042) - 1 = **+2.16%**.

Notice the percentages are not mirror images\!

> [\!TIP]
> **CFA Exam Tip ‚úçÔ∏è:** The exam will test your ability to distinguish between nominal and real rates and to correctly calculate appreciation/depreciation. Always be clear about which currency is the base currency. If the `A/B` rate goes up, currency B has appreciated.

### Part 2: Rules of the Road - Exchange Rate Regimes üö¶

An **exchange rate regime** is the framework a country adopts for its currency's exchange rate. This framework exists on a spectrum from rigidly fixed to freely floating.

        B --> C(Floating Regimes<br/><i>Managed Float, Independent Float</i>);
    end
    style A fill:#add8e6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#90ee90,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Categories of Regimes:**

1.  **Countries Without Their Own Currency:**

      * **Formal Dollarization:** A country gives up its currency and adopts the currency of another country (e.g., Ecuador uses the US dollar). It completely gives up monetary policy independence.
      * **Monetary Union:** Several countries share a common currency and a single central bank (e.g., the Eurozone).

2.  **Countries With Their Own Currency:**

      *   **Fixed Regimes:**
          *   **Currency Board:** A very rigid peg where the domestic currency is fully backed by a foreign currency at a fixed rate (e.g., Hong Kong's link to the USD).
          *   **Conventional Fixed Peg:** The country pegs its currency to another currency or a basket of currencies within a narrow band of ¬±1%.
          *   **Target Zone:** A fixed peg with a wider band (e.g., ¬±2%).
          *   **Crawling Peg:** The peg is adjusted periodically, usually to account for inflation differences.

      *   **Floating Regimes:**
          *   **Managed Float:** The central bank actively intervenes to influence the exchange rate without a specific target. This is what countries like India and China practice.
          *   **Independently Floating:** The exchange rate is determined purely by market forces of supply and demand. The central bank rarely intervenes (e.g., USD, JPY).

### Mnemonic for Exchange Rate Regimes

A helpful mnemonic to remember the order of regimes from most rigid to most flexible is:

**D**ogs **M**ust **C**arry **C**ats **T**o **C**atch **M**ice **I**ndividually

*   **D**ogs = **D**ollarization
*   **M**ust = **M**onetary Union
*   **C**arry = **C**urrency Board
*   **C**ats = **C**onventional Fixed Peg
*   **T**o = **T**arget Zone
*   **C**atch = **C**rawling Peg
*   **M**ice = **M**anaged Float
*   **I**ndividually = **I**ndependently Floating

### Part 3: The Domino Effect - Exchange Rates and the Economy üí•

Changes in exchange rates have powerful effects on a country's trade and capital flows.

#### **The Elasticities and Absorption Approaches**

  * **Elasticities Approach:** This focuses on how a currency depreciation affects the **trade balance** (Exports - Imports). A weaker currency makes exports cheaper for foreigners and imports more expensive for locals. If demand for exports and imports is sufficiently elastic (responsive to price changes), a depreciation will improve the trade balance.
  * **Absorption Approach:** This looks at the trade balance from a different angle: **`Trade Balance = National Income - National Absorption`** (where absorption is total spending). To improve the trade balance, a country must either increase its income (produce more) or decrease its absorption (spend less).

#### **The Link Between Trade and Capital Flows**

This is a fundamental macroeconomic identity:

$$(\text{Exports} - \text{Imports}) = (\text{Private Savings} - \text{Investment}) + (\text{Tax Revenue} - \text{Gov't Spending})$$

  * A **trade deficit** (Imports \> Exports) means the left side is negative.
  * This *must* be balanced by the right side. It implies that a country's domestic investment is greater than its domestic savings (`I > S`).
  * How is this gap funded? By a **capital account surplus**‚Äîa net inflow of foreign capital.

In simple terms: **A country that runs a trade deficit is spending more than it produces, and it finances this by borrowing from the rest of the world.**

> [\!TIP]
> **CFA Exam Tip ‚úçÔ∏è:** The link between the current account (trade) and the capital account is a crucial, frequently tested concept. Remember: **Current Account Deficit = Capital Account Surplus**. They are two sides of the same coin.

### Part 4: Building Fences for Money - Capital Restrictions üöß

Governments sometimes impose **capital restrictions** to limit the flow of investment capital across their borders.

**Common Objectives:**

  * **Reduce Volatility:** To prevent huge, destabilizing inflows or outflows of "hot money" that can cause domestic asset prices to bubble or crash.
  * **Maintain Monetary Policy Control:** Unrestricted capital flows can make it difficult for a central bank to control its domestic interest rates and money supply.
  * **Protect Strategic Industries:** To prevent foreign takeovers of industries deemed critical to national security.

### üß™ Formula Summary

  * **Real Exchange Rate (d/f):**
    $$\text{Real Exchange Rate (d/f)} = \text{Nominal Rate (d/f)} \times \left( \frac{CPI_{f}}{CPI_{d}} \right)$$
  * **Percentage Change in Currency Value:**
    $$\Delta = \left( \frac{Rate_{end}}{Rate_{begin}} \right) - 1$$
  * **Macroeconomic Balance Equation:**
    $$X - M = (S - I) + (T - G)$$

>
>   * **Base vs. Price:** Always identify the base and price currencies in a quote. If `USD/EUR` goes from 1.40 to 1.50, the euro (base) has appreciated.
>   * **Real vs. Nominal:** The **real exchange rate** is the **nominal rate adjusted for inflation**. It reflects true purchasing power.
>   * **Regime Spectrum:** Know the hierarchy of exchange rate regimes from most rigid (dollarization) to most flexible (independent float).
>   * **Two Sides of the Coin:** A **current account deficit** MUST be financed by a **capital account surplus**. A country that buys more than it sells must borrow from foreigners to pay for it.
