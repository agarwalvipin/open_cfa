## Reading 17 — International Trade

*(Economics Topic Area | CFA Level I)*

Below is a **LOS-by-LOS breakdown** with India-centric illustrations, must-know exam notes, and end-of-reading quick sheets.

### LOS 17.a Describe the benefits **and** costs of international trade 

| Gains                                        | How it looks on the ground (India)                                                                                                                   | Costs                                                    | Who feels the pinch                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Comparative advantage & scale-efficiency** | India exports **generic formulations** where its chemistry talent & low cost shine; imports patented oncology drugs it cannot yet make competitively | **Structural job losses** in the import-competing sector | Mumbai’s bulk-drug plants lost share when China’s APIs became cheaper         |
| **Greater product variety & competition**    | 10-lakh-rupee hatchbacks from Korea coexist with ₹4-crore German EVs—wider consumer choice                                                           | **Short-run wage compression / inequality**              | Power-loom workers in Surat face lower wages vs high-skill IT exports gaining |
| **Lower monopoly power, lower prices**       | Post-2001 tariff cuts halved average smartphone prices                                                                                               | **Adjustment costs** (re-skilling, retraining)           | Govt spends on PM-KVY schemes to re-skill displaced textile labour            |

> **CFA tip:** If the vignette shows both countries’ PPFs expanding, the question tests *gains from trade*, not *terms-of-trade*. Draw a quick two-good graph in the margin.

### LOS 17.b Compare trade restrictions—tariffs, quotas, export subsidies, etc.—and their economic effects 

| Restriction                          | “Expansionary” move                         | Domestic winners             | Domestic losers                       | India flash-card                                    |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tariff** (import tax)              | Govt slaps 20 % duty on steel               | Steel mills, exchequer       | Auto companies, car buyers            | 2018 safeguard duty on solar panels                 |
| **Import quota**                     | Cap at 2 mn tonnes palm oil/year            | Domestic edible-oil crushers | Consumers (higher price)              | 2020 refined-palm-oil quota                         |
| **Voluntary export restraint (VER)** | Foreign exporter self-limits supply         | Domestic producers           | Foreign firm, home consumers abroad   | Japanese auto VER to U.S. 1980s (learn as template) |
| **Min. domestic content**            | 50 % of defence jet must be “Make-in-India” | Local component makers       | Foreign OEMs, taxpayers (higher cost) | Rafale offset policy                                |
| **Export subsidy**                   | Govt gives ₹6/kg sugar export subsidy       | Sugar mills, cane farmers    | Indian taxpayers; global rivals       | 2021-22 sugar subsidy dispute at WTO                |

> **Exam hack:** *Tariff vs quota*: only **tariffs** raise government revenue; quotas create import-license rents. Spot the trick!

### LOS 17.c Explain motivations for and advantages of trading blocs, common markets & economic unions 

| Level of integration      | Key features                                     | Why countries sign up     | South-Asian / global cue   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Free Trade Area (FTA)** | Zero internal tariffs                            | Scale & consumer surplus  | **ASEAN–India FTA (2010)** |
| **Customs Union**         | FTA + common external tariff                     | Simpler border admin      | Mercosur                   |
| **Common Market**         | Customs Union + free movement of labour/ capital | Factor-market efficiency  | EEA (EU + EFTA parts)      |
| **Economic Union**        | Common Market + aligned economic policy          | Macro-policy coordination | EU pre-€                   |
| **Monetary Union**        | Economic Union + single currency                 | Eliminates FX risk        | **Eurozone**               |

**Why bloc up?**

* **Collective bargaining power** versus larger economies.
* **Reduced transaction costs** & integrated supply chains (e.g., automobile clusters across EU).
* **Political signalling** of reform commitment (AfCFTA).

*But:* trade diverted from more efficient non-members can erode welfare, especially if external tariffs rise.

> **Quick recall mnemonic:** *F-C-C-E-M → “Fancy Customs Can Ease Money”* (FTA, Customs Union, Common Market, Economic Union, Monetary Union).

## 📑 “Formula” Sheet – Reading 17

International-trade math is light, but scribble these on your crib sheet:

| Concept                          | Formula / Rule                                                                       |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Terms of Trade (ToT)**         | $\text{ToT}= \frac{\text{Export Price Index}}{\text{Import Price Index}} \times 100$ |
| **Tariff welfare loss**          | Deadweight loss = ½ × tariff × (import reduction)                                    |
| **Effective rate of protection** | $\text{ERP} = \frac{V_d - V_w}{V_w}$ (value added with vs without tariff)            |

*(They’re fair game for a plug-and-play numerical question even if not highlighted in Schweser.)*

## 🚀 Quick Exam-Day Pointers

1. **Graph mastery**: Draw the small-country tariff diagram—consumer surplus, producer surplus, govt revenue, DWL.
2. **Winners & losers** table: commit to memory; MCQs love “who gains?” twists.
3. **VER vs quota**: both limit quantity, but VER revenue accrues abroad; quotas create domestic rents.
4. **Bloc hierarchy**: Free Trade Area ←→ Monetary Union. Sketch F-C-C-E-M arrows in margin first.
5. **India twist**: recall at least one real example (e.g., smartphone tariff, Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership opt-out) to cement theory.
6. **No math?** Don’t relax—expect conceptual traps on *comparative vs absolute advantage* or *trade-diversion vs trade-creation*.

### ✏️ Last-Minute Cheat-card

* Tariff ↑ ⇒ Pdom ↑, Qimport ↓, CS ↓, PS ↑, Rev ↑.
* Quota? Same except **no revenue unless licenses auctioned**.
* FTA < Customs < Common < Econ < Monetary (remember the order).
* ToT >100 = favourable.

Stick this on the back of your calculator cover—glance at it during that 2-minute stretch break between item sets.

You’re set, Vipin—trade theory is now your comparative advantage. Go score those easy marks!
