### Reading 13 – **Understanding Business Cycles**

*(Economics Topic, Module 13.1, LOS 13.a – 13.c) – Level I 2025 Curriculum*

---

## LOS 13.a Describe the business-cycle and its phases

| Phase                       | Core features                                                               | Indian illustration                                                                     | CFA-exam focus ✏️                                                              |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Expansion / Recovery**    | ↑ Real GDP, ↑ employment, rising capacity utilisation, modest inflation     | FY 2003-08: IT-led cap-ex boom, double-digit IIP, bank-credit growth above 25 % y-y     | Know *output gap* sign (+) and typical policy stance (monetary **tightening**) |
| **Peak**                    | Growth > potential, labour and commodity markets tight, full capacity       | Q1 FY 2008: WPI inflation > 8 %, RBI hiked CRR & repo                                   | Remember that *inflation and wages* peak **after** activity does               |
| **Contraction / Recession** | ↓ Spending, falling profits & new orders, rising inventories & unemployment | FY 2012-13 slowdown; Covid-19 lockdown Q1 FY 2021 saw -23.9 % real GDP                  | Inventory-sales ratio is a *leading* indicator for this phase                  |
| **Trough**                  | Excess capacity, disinflation, policy support gains traction                | Q4 FY 2021: RBI kept repo at 4 %, centre announced infra push; GST collections bottomed | Fiscal multipliers strongest here; *leading* indicators turn first             |

> **Exam hint:** The CFA Institute often asks which **sector** turns first—*housing* and *consumer durables* usually lead both downturns and recoveries. Highlight these on your formula sheet.

## LOS 13.b Describe credit cycles

| Stage of credit cycle           | Indian context                                                                     | Key takeaway for CFA L1                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Credit expansion**            | 2015-17 MCLR-linked bank loans and NBFC retail lending surged; home-loan EMIs fell | Corporate leverage ↑, default risk under-priced – expect narrower credit-spreads |
| **Credit peak**                 | Mar-2018: IL\&FS default shocked money-markets; NBFC CP spreads spiked             | Liquidity dries up *before* real economy contracts                               |
| **De-leveraging / contraction** | 2018-20 NBFC crisis + PSB clean-up; credit growth fell below nominal GDP           | Watch **bank-loan growth** & **yield-spreads** as coincident indicators          |
| **Repair / early expansion**    | 2021-24: ECLGS, balance-sheet clean-ups; credit growth back above 15 %             | Wider spreads but falling – signal of trough in credit cycle                     |

> **Quick-fire exam tip:** Link the credit cycle to the **business-cycle amplitude**—an over-extended credit boom often **amplifies** the next downturn (think 2008 GFC).

## LOS 13.c Describe how key sectors & indicators vary across the cycle

| Sector / Activity        | Indian real-world indicators                                                                   | Pro-cyclical / Counter-cyclical?                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Resource utilisation** | *Capacity Utilisation (CU)* survey by RBI; *Electricity demand* (POSOCO)                       | Pro-cyclical – CU > 75 % in booms                               |
| **Consumer activity**    | Monthly *GST e-way bills*, *Passenger vehicle sales*, *Nielsen FMCG index*                     | Non-durables lag; durables lead                                 |
| **Business investment**  | *Gross Fixed Capital Formation*, *Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) cap-ex database* | Highly pro-cyclical; collapses in recessions                    |
| **Housing**              | *Housing starts* (RERA filings); *Cement dispatches*; home-loan approvals                      | Classic **leading** series                                      |
| **External trade**       | *Merchandise exports (USD)*, *Container rail traffic*                                          | Sensitive to global cycle & INR; watch when India is export-led |

**Indicator families (know at least one example for the exam)**

* **Leading:** PMI-Manufacturing > 50, Yield-curve spread (10y-T-bill), Auto sales
* **Coincident:** IIP, Employment payrolls (EPFO net adds)
* **Lagging:** CPI-inflation, Bank NPL ratio

> **Bright-green reminder 🟢**: The CFA® exam frequently asks you to *classify* an indicator; memorise 2-3 from each bucket.

## Formulas appearing in Reading 13

| Concept                   | Formula | Usage                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Output gap**            |         | Measures stage of cycle                       |
| **Inventory-sales ratio** |         | Leading indicator of contraction              |
| **Diffusion index**       |         | PMI construction (> 50 = expansion)           |
| **Composite index**       |         | Weighted-sum of normalised leading indicators |

*(Reading 13 is mostly conceptual, but jot these down on your formula sheet for quick recall.)*

## Quick exam-day pointers 🗸

1. **Time management:** Business-cycle items show up in both Economics item sets and vignette‐style Ethics-linked macro questions—expect \~2–3 questions.
2. **Key trigger words:** “*Output gap positive*” ⇒ economy near **peak**; “*policy rate neutral to accommodative*” ⇒ **trough / early expansion**.
3. **Mnemonic for phases:** **E-P-C-T** → **E**xpansion → **P**eak → **C**ontraction → **T**rough (repeat).
4. **India angle memory hook:** Relate expansion to **2003-08**, contraction to **2012** & **2020**, recovery to **2021-22**—personal experience sticks better than rote!
5. **Credit vs. business cycle:** If a stem mentions *widening corporate spreads* or *loan officers tightening standards*, think **late expansion / early contraction**.

### Final 60-second flash sheet 🔖

* Phases: E-P-C-T sequence
* Credit amplifies cycle, peaks slightly **after** economic peak
* Housing & consumer durables **lead**; inflation **lags**
* Output gap sign ↔ policy stance
* Leading / Coincident / Lagging examples (learn 2 each)

*Walk into the exam able to sketch this story, and Reading 13 is easy marks.* Good luck!
