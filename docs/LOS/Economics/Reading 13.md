## Reading 13: Understanding Business Cycles

### 🎯 Introduction

Welcome, future charterholder! Think of the economy as a rollercoaster 🎢. It has thrilling climbs (expansions), breathtaking peaks, stomach-lurching drops (recessions), and moments at the bottom (troughs) before it starts climbing again. This natural rhythm of ups and downs is what we call the **business cycle**. This reading is your guide to understanding this rollercoaster ride. We'll explore each phase, learn how different parts of the economy react during the ride, and discover the secret signals economists use to predict the next big turn!

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 1: The Four Phases of the Economic Rollercoaster 🎢 (LOS 13.a)</span>

The **business cycle** is the ongoing fluctuation in economic activity. Economists have identified four distinct phases. It's important to remember that these cycles don't happen at perfectly regular intervals, but they do follow a consistent pattern.

* **Classical Cycle:** This looks at the absolute level of real GDP. Is the economy's total output going up or down?
* **Growth Cycle:** This compares the economy's actual growth to its long-term trend. Are we growing faster or slower than our average potential?
* **Growth Rate Cycle:** This focuses on the change in the GDP growth rate itself. Is the *pace* of our growth speeding up or slowing down?

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.1 Expansion (The Climb Up 📈)</span>
* **What's happening:** Real GDP is growing. Businesses are confident and investing in new equipment and factories.
* **Jobs:** Unemployment falls as companies hire more workers. You might even see wages start to rise.
* **Spending:** Consumers feel good about the economy and start buying big-ticket items like cars and new homes (**durable goods**).
* **Inflation:** Inflation is usually stable at first but can start to creep up as demand outstrips supply.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.2 Peak (The Top of the Hill ⛰️)</span>
* **What's happening:** The economy has reached its maximum output. GDP growth starts to slow down.
* **Jobs:** Hiring slows, but unemployment is at its lowest point.
* **Spending:** Business investment and consumer spending growth rates slow down.
* **Inflation:** This is often when inflation is at its highest.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.3 Contraction / Recession (The Drop 📉)</span>
* **What's happening:** Real GDP is falling. A common rule of thumb for a **recession** is two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth.
* **Jobs:** Unemployment starts to rise as businesses lay off workers.
* **Spending:** Consumers and businesses become cautious. They cut back on spending, especially on durables and investments.
* **Inflation:** Inflationary pressures ease up and may even fall.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.4 Trough (The Bottom đáy)</span>
* **What's happening:** The economy stops shrinking and prepares for a new expansion. GDP growth goes from negative back to positive.
* **Jobs:** Unemployment is at its highest, but companies might start hiring temporary workers as they anticipate a recovery.
* **Spending:** Spending on housing and durable goods often starts to pick up as lower interest rates make them more affordable.
* **Inflation:** Inflation is typically at its lowest point.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 2: Key Economic Sectors and Their Behavior (LOS 13.b)</span>

Different parts of the economy behave differently throughout the cycle. Paying attention to them gives you clues about where we are and where we're going.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.1 Resource Use & Inventories 📦</span>
This is a super important, and often misunderstood, part of the cycle. The **inventory-sales ratio** is a key indicator.

* **Approaching a Peak:** Sales growth slows down, but companies are still producing a lot. Unsold goods pile up in warehouses, and the inventory-sales ratio **rises**. This is a warning sign! To fix this, firms cut production, which can trigger a contraction.
* **Approaching a Trough:** During the recession, firms cut production way back. As recovery begins, sales pick up unexpectedly. Inventories get depleted quickly, and the inventory-sales ratio **falls**. To meet demand, firms ramp up production, fueling the expansion.

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

**💡 CFA Exam Tip ✍️:** The exam loves testing the inventory-sales ratio. An analyst looking only at rising GDP might think the economy is strong. But if that GDP growth is from an *unplanned* buildup of inventories (a high inventory-sales ratio), it's actually a sign of weakness ahead!

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.2 Consumer and Business Activity 🛍️🏢</span>
* **Durable Goods:** Spending on items that last a long time (cars, appliances, furniture) is **highly sensitive** to the cycle. People postpone these big purchases when they're worried about their jobs.
* **Non-Durable Goods & Services:** Spending on necessities like food, household products, and healthcare is **less sensitive**. People need to buy groceries whether the economy is booming or busting.
* **Business Investment:** Companies spend heavily on new equipment and factories during expansions but cut back sharply during contractions.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.3 Housing Sector Activity 🏠</span>
The housing market is very cyclical and is influenced by:

* **Mortgage Rates:** Lower rates make homes more affordable and boost activity.
* **Income Levels:** When people's incomes are rising, they are more likely to buy houses.
* **Speculation:** If home prices have been rising quickly, people might buy houses purely as an investment, which can create a bubble.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.4 External Trade 🚢</span>
A country's imports and exports are also tied to business cycles.

* **Imports:** When a country's economy is expanding, its citizens have more income to spend, so they buy more foreign goods (**imports increase**).
* **Exports:** A country's exports depend on the economies of *other* countries. If the U.S. is in an expansion, it will import more goods from India, boosting India's exports.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 3: The Credit Cycle 💳 (LOS 13.c)</span>

The **credit cycle** is closely related to the business cycle and refers to the expansion and contraction of access to credit.

* **Expansion:** When the economy is strong, lenders are more willing to lend money. Credit is easy to get, which fuels more spending and investment.
* **Contraction:** When the economy weakens, lenders get nervous. They tighten their lending standards, making it harder to get loans. This credit crunch can make a recession worse. Sectors that rely heavily on credit, like **construction**, are very sensitive to the credit cycle.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 4: Economic Indicators: The Dashboard Gauges 🚦 (LOS 13.d)</span>

Economists use specific data points, called **economic indicators**, to track the business cycle. They fall into three categories based on their timing relative to the overall economy.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">4.1 Indicator Types</span>

| Indicator Type | Definition | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Leading Indicators** 🚥 | Change *before* the overall economy. They are used to predict the future. | - S&P 500 stock index <br> - Building permits <br> - Average weekly manufacturing hours |
| **Coincident Indicators** ↔️ | Change *at the same time* as the overall economy. They show the current state. | - Industrial production <br> - Manufacturing and trade sales |
| **Lagging Indicators** 🐢 | Change *after* the overall economy. They are used to confirm a pattern. | - Average prime rate <br> - Unemployment rate <br> - Inventory-sales ratio |

<div style="background-color: #E3F2FD; border-left: 5px solid #1976D2; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

**💡 CFA Exam Tip ✍️:** Be ready to classify indicators! The CFA exam will likely ask you to identify whether an indicator is leading, lagging, or coincident. The unemployment rate is a classic *lagging* indicator—companies wait until they are sure a recovery is solid before they start hiring again in large numbers.

### 🎯 Quick Exam-Day Pointers

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

* **Know the 4 Phases:** 
  * **Expansion** (GDP 📈, jobs 📈)
  * **Peak** (growth slows)
  * **Contraction** (GDP 📉, jobs 📉)
  * **Trough** (bottoming out)
* **Watch Inventories:** 
  * A rising **inventory-sales ratio** is a red flag at the top of a cycle (→ possible contraction).
  * A falling ratio is a green light at the bottom (→ possible expansion).
* **Sector Sensitivity:** 
  * Spending on **durable goods** and **housing** is very cyclical (⬇️ in contraction, ⬆️ in expansion).
  * Spending on **non-durables** and services is not.
* **Indicators are Key:** 
  * **Leading** indicators predict (e.g., S&P 500).
  * **Coincident** indicators describe the present.
  * **Lagging** indicators confirm the past (e.g., unemployment rate).
* **Credit Matters:** 
  * The **credit cycle** can amplify the business cycle. Easy credit fuels booms (⬆️), and tight credit worsens busts (⬇️).

### <span style="color: #00838F;">Global & Local Context 🌍</span>

* **Global Example:** The 2008 global financial crisis showed how synchronized contractions in credit and housing sectors can trigger worldwide recessions. U.S. housing and credit contraction led to global trade declines.
* **Indian Example:** During India's 2016 demonetization, contraction in credit availability led to a sharp slowdown in consumer spending and business investment, illustrating the sensitivity of the business cycle to credit shocks.
