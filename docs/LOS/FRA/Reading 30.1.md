### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 1: Analyzing Cash Flow from Operations (LOS 30.a)</span>

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.1 Introduction</span>

**Cash Flow from Operations (CFO)** is the lifeblood of a company! ü©∏
It measures the cash generated or used by a company's normal, day-to-day business activities‚Äîthe core things it does to make money, like selling goods or services.
Think of it as the cash coming in and going out from the main business engine.
Understanding CFO helps analysts assess if a company can sustain itself, pay its bills, and fund growth internally.
Net income tells part of the story, but CFO tells the *cash* story.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 2: Two Methods, One Result (LOS 30.b)</span>

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.1 Overview</span>

Companies can report CFO using two different methods: **Direct** or **Indirect**.

* **Direct Method:** Lists actual cash received and paid out. üßæ
* **Indirect Method:** Starts with Net Income and adjusts it back to a cash basis. üß©

Both methods will *always* give you the **same final CFO number**.
The choice only affects the presentation of the CFO section; Cash Flow from Investing (CFI) and Cash Flow from Financing (CFF) are presented the same way regardless.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 3: The Direct Method ("Cash Register" Approach) (LOS 30.c)</span>

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">3.1 Key Steps & Components</span>

1.  Go line-by-line through the operating section of the Income Statement (Sales, COGS, Operating Expenses).
2.  For each line, find the related operating Asset and Liability accounts on the Balance Sheet (e.g., Sales relates to Accounts Receivable and Unearned Revenue).
3.  Calculate the change in those Balance Sheet accounts during the period.
4.  Adjust the Income Statement amount using the **CAL Rule** to find the cash flow component:
    * **CAL Rule:** Changes in Current **A**ssets have an *opposite* impact on cash (Asset ‚Üë uses cash ‚ûñ, Asset ‚Üì sources cash ‚ûï).
      Changes in Current **L**iabilities have the *same* impact on cash (Liability ‚Üë sources cash ‚ûï, Liability ‚Üì uses cash ‚ûñ).
      *Remember to treat expenses as negative numbers when applying the rule.*
5.  Ignore non-cash items (like Depreciation, Amortization) and gains/losses related to investing or financing activities (like Gain on Sale of PP&E).

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">3.2 Major Line Items Calculated</span>

* **(+) Cash collected from customers**
* **(-) Cash paid to suppliers**
* **(-) Cash expenses paid** (e.g., wages, rent)
* **(-) Cash interest paid** (*Classification depends on GAAP/IFRS*)
* **(-) Cash taxes paid** (*Classification depends on GAAP/IFRS*)
* **(¬±) Interest/Dividends received** (*Classification depends on GAAP/IFRS*)
* (¬±) Cash flows from buying/selling **Trading Securities**

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 4: The Indirect Method ("Reconciliation" Approach) (LOS 30.d)</span>

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">4.1 Key Steps & Components</span>

1.  **Start with Net Income**.
2.  **Add Back Non-Cash Charges (NCC):** Expenses that reduced Net Income but didn't involve a cash outflow in the period.
    * Think: "**D**epressed **A**ssets **I**ncur **S**ad **P**roblems"
      * **(D) Depreciation & (A) Amortization** (+)
      * **(I) Impairments** (+)
      * **(S) Stock-based Compensation** (+)
      * **(P) Provisions** (increases in bad debt, warranty allowances) (+)
      * Amortization of bond *discounts* (+)
      * Increases in Deferred Tax Liabilities (DTL) / Decreases in Deferred Tax Assets (DTA) (+)
      * Unrealized losses on *trading* securities (+)
3.  **Adjust for Non-Operating Gains (-) / Losses (+):** Items included in Net Income but stemming from Investing (CFI) or Financing (CFF) activities.
    * Think: "**G**ood **L**uck!" (Subtract Gains, Add Losses)
      * **(-) (G) Gains** on disposal of PP&E, investments, or debt retirement
      * **(+) (L) Losses** on disposal of PP&E, investments, or debt retirement
      * (-) Amortization of bond *premiums*
      * (-) Decreases in DTL / Increases in DTA
      * (-) Unrealized gains on *trading* securities
4.  **Adjust for Changes in Working Capital Accounts:** Reflects cash tied up or released from day-to-day operating assets and liabilities. Use the **CAL Rule**:
    * **CAL Rule:** "**CAL**m **W**aters **C**an **A**lways **L**ift"
      * Current **A**ssets ‚û°Ô∏è **Opposite**: Treat changes *opposite* to cash flow impact.
        * (-) Increase in A/R, Inventory, Prepaids (Cash Used)
        * (+) Decrease in A/R, Inventory, Prepaids (Cash Sourced)
      * Current **L**iabilities ‚û°Ô∏è **Same**: Treat changes the *same* as cash flow impact.
        * (+) Increase in A/P, Accrued Expenses, Taxes Payable, Unearned Rev (Cash Sourced)
        * (-) Decrease in A/P, Accrued Expenses, Taxes Payable, Unearned Rev (Cash Used)

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 6: Link to Free Cash Flow (FCF) (LOS 30.f)</span>

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">6.1 Formula Summary</span>

* **FCFF (Free Cash Flow to Firm):** Cash available to *all* capital providers (debt & equity).
  <div style="background-color: #F5F5F5; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;">
  $$\text{FCFF} = \text{CFO} + \text{Interest Expense} \times (1 - \text{Tax Rate}) - \text{FCInv}$$
  </div>
* **FCFE (Free Cash Flow to Equity):** Cash available to *common shareholders*.
  <div style="background-color: #F5F5F5; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;">
  $$\text{FCFE} = \text{CFO} - \text{FCInv} + \text{Net Borrowing}$$
  </div>
    * *(Where FCInv = Fixed Capital Investment (Capex - Proceeds from Asset Sales))*
    * *(Where Net Borrowing = Debt Issued - Debt Repaid)*

#### <span style="color: #00838F;">Global & Local Context üåç</span>

* In India, companies often use the indirect method for CFO reporting, but direct method disclosures are encouraged for transparency.
* Internationally, IFRS allows more flexibility in classification, which can impact cross-border analysis.
