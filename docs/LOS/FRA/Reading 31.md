### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Reading 31: Analyzing Statements of Cash Flows II üîç</span>

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">üéØ Introduction</span>

Welcome back, future charterholder! In Reading 30, we learned how to *construct* the Statement of Cash Flows. Now, it's time to put on our analyst hats üë®‚Äçüî¨üë©‚Äçüî¨ and really *interpret* what it tells us. Think of Reading 30 as getting your blood pressure and heart rate readings; Reading 31 is like the doctor analyzing those numbers to understand your overall health! We'll learn how to evaluate a company's cash generation patterns across its operating, investing, and financing activities, assess the quality of its earnings, and calculate crucial metrics like **Free Cash Flow** ‚Äì the cash truly available after maintaining the business. Let's diagnose!

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.1 Key Evaluation Points</span>

* **Overall Picture:** Where is the cash coming from, and where is it going? Is the company funding itself through operations, borrowing, or selling assets?
* **Company Life Cycle:**
  * **Early Growth:** Often negative CFO (building inventory/receivables), negative CFI (heavy investment), positive CFF (raising capital). Needs to eventually generate positive CFO to survive! üå±
  * **Mature:** Positive CFO (main source of cash), CFI for maintenance and strategic growth, CFF might be negative (paying debt, dividends, buybacks). üí∞
  * **Decline:** CFO might shrink, CFI could be positive (selling assets), CFF might be negative (paying down debt). üìâ
* **Operating Cash Flow (CFO) Analysis:**
  * **Primary Source:** Should ideally come from core **earnings-related activities**. ‚úÖ
  * **Sustainability:** Positive CFO generated by *decreasing* working capital (selling off inventory, delaying supplier payments) isn't sustainable long-term. Watch out! ‚ö†Ô∏è
  * **Earnings Quality:** CFO should ideally track Net Income. If Net Income is consistently higher than CFO, it could signal **aggressive accounting** (e.g., recognizing revenue too soon). A stable CFO/Net Income relationship suggests higher quality earnings. üëç
  * **Variability:** High volatility in CFO and Net Income can indicate higher risk.
* **Investing Cash Flow (CFI) Analysis:**
  * **Capital Expenditures (CapEx):** Increasing CapEx usually signals growth. üìà Decreasing CapEx or selling assets might generate cash now but could hurt future competitiveness if assets aren't replaced. Needs investigation! üßê
  * **Acquisitions/Investments:** Significant cash outflows here show expansion through buying other companies or securities.
* **Financing Cash Flow (CFF) Analysis:**
  * **Debt & Equity:** Shows if the firm is raising cash by issuing debt or equity (+) or using cash to repay debt, buy back stock, or pay dividends (-).
  * **Red Flags:** Is the company borrowing heavily just to pay dividends or buy back stock? This might not be sustainable. ü§î

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.2 Common-Size Cash Flow Statements: Standardizing for Comparison üìè</span>

Just like with the Income Statement and Balance Sheet, creating **common-size cash flow statements** helps compare trends over time and across different companies by removing size effects. Two main ways:

* **As a Percentage of Revenue:** Each cash flow item (e.g., Cash Collected from Customers, CapEx, Dividends Paid) is shown as % of total revenue. Useful for seeing efficiency and forecasting.
* **As a Percentage of Total Inflows/Outflows:** Each cash inflow is shown as % of total cash inflows; each outflow as % of total cash outflows. Highlights the relative importance of different sources and uses.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.3 Example: Common-Size Analysis (Triple Y Corp) üßÆ</span>

(Based on % of Revenue data from the reading)

| Item (% Revenue)         | 20X9    | 20X8    | 20X7    | Trend Analysis                                                                                                |
| :----------------------- | :------ | :------ | :------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Net Income               | 13.4%   | 13.4%   | 13.5%   | Stable profit margin.                                                                                         |
| Depreciation             | 4.0%    | 3.9%    | 3.9%    | Stable noncash charge.                                                                                        |
| Inventory Change         | **-10.3%** | -9.2%   | -8.8%   | **Large negative impact!** Inventory is *increasing* significantly relative to revenue, consuming cash. üìâ |
| **Operating Cash Flow** | **12.2%** | **12.8%** | **13.8%** | **Decreasing.** Primarily driven by the large cash drain from inventory build-up.                      |
| Purchase Plant & Equip.  | -12.3%  | -12.0%  | -11.7%  | Increasing investment in fixed assets relative to revenue.                                                    |
| **Investing Cash Flow** | **-11.6%** | **-11.3%** | **-11.0%** | **Increasing outflow.** Higher capital spending.                                                       |
| Sale of Bonds            | 2.6%    | 2.5%    | 2.6%    | Stable financing inflow.                                                                                      |
| Cash Dividends           | -2.1%   | -2.1%   | -2.1%   | Stable dividend outflow relative to revenue.                                                                  |
| **Financing Cash Flow** | 0.5%    | 0.4%    | 0.5%    | Stable net inflow.                                                                                            |
| **Total Cash Flow** | **1.1%** | **1.9%** | **3.3%** | **Decreasing.** Lower CFO and higher CFI outflows are reducing overall cash generation relative to revenue. |

<div style="background-color: #E3F2FD; border-left: 5px solid #1976D2; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">
**Interpretation:** Triple Y's overall cash generation relative to sales is shrinking. The main culprit appears to be a significant build-up in inventory, which is dragging down CFO. Combined with slightly higher investment spending (CFI), the company's ability to increase its cash pile from each dollar of revenue is weakening. An analyst should investigate *why* inventory is piling up ‚Äì is it strategic stocking for growth, or a sign of slowing sales and potential obsolescence? ü§î

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.1 Free Cash Flow (FCF): The Discretionary Cash üí∏</span>

<div style="background-color: #F3E5F5; border-left: 5px solid #7B1FA2; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">
**üí° MNEMONIC: "FCFF vs FCFE - Firm First, Equity Ends"**
- **FCFF** = Free Cash to **FIRM** (all capital providers - debt & equity)
- **FCFE** = Free Cash to **EQUITY** (only common shareholders)
- Think: **FIRM** comes before **EQUITY** in capital structure priority
</div>
</div>

**Free Cash Flow** measures the cash generated by a company that is available for discretionary purposes (like paying dividends, share buybacks, or debt paydowns) *after* making the necessary investments (capital expenditures) to maintain and grow the business. It's a key input for valuation. Two common types:

* **Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF):** Cash available to *all* capital providers (debtholders and equity holders). It's calculated *before* interest payments to debt holders (but after taxes on that interest).
  * **Starting from Net Income:**
    <div style="background-color: #F5F5F5; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;">
    $$
    \text{FCFF} = \text{NI} + \text{NCC} + [\text{Int} \times (1 - \text{Tax Rate})] - \text{FCInv} - \text{WCInv}
    $$
    </div>
    Where:
    * $\text{NI}$ = Net Income
    * $\text{NCC}$ = Noncash Charges (like Depreciation, Amortization, add back losses, subtract gains)
    * $\text{Int}$ = **Cash Interest Paid**
    * $\text{FCInv}$ = Fixed Capital Investment = CapEx - Proceeds from sale of long-term assets
    * $\text{WCInv}$ = Investment in Working Capital = Change in (Operating Current Assets - Operating Current Liabilities)
  * **Starting from CFO (often simpler):**
    <div style="background-color: #F5F5F5; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;">
    $$
    \text{FCFF} = \text{CFO} + [\text{Int} \times (1 - \text{Tax Rate})] - \text{FCInv}
    $$
    </div>
    *(Note: If using IFRS and interest was classed as CFF, don't add it back here).*

* **Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE):** Cash available *only* to common shareholders after payments to debtholders (interest and principal) and preferred shareholders.
  * **Starting from CFO:**
    <div style="background-color: #F5F5F5; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;">
    $$
    \text{FCFE} = \text{CFO} - \text{FCInv} + \text{Net Borrowing}
    $$
    </div>
    Where:
    * $\text{Net Borrowing}$ = Debt Issued - Debt Repaid
    *(Note: If using IFRS and dividends paid were classed as CFO, add them back here).*
  * **Starting from FCFF:**
    <div style="background-color: #F5F5F5; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;">
    $$
    \text{FCFE} = \text{FCFF} - [\text{Int} \times (1 - \text{Tax Rate})] + \text{Net Borrowing}
    $$
    </div>

#### <span style="color: #E65100;">2.2 Example: FCFF & FCFE Calculation üßÆ</span>

Using data derived from the Reading 30 examples (assuming 40% tax rate):

* CFO = \$50,000
* Cash Interest Paid (Int) = \$500
* Fixed Capital Investment (FCInv) = \$25,000 (Purchases) - \$25,000 (Total Proceeds from land & PP&E sales) = \$0
* Net Borrowing = \$5,000 (Bonds Issued) - \$0 (Repayments assumed) = \$5,000 *(Simplified from CFF section)*

**FCFF Calculation:**
<div style="background-color: #F5F5F5; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;">
$$
\text{FCFF} = \text{CFO} + [\text{Int} \times (1 - \text{Tax Rate})] - \text{FCInv}
$$

$$
\text{FCFF} = \$50,000 + [\$500 \times (1 - 0.40)] - \$0
$$

$$
\text{FCFF} = \$50,000 + \$300 - \$0 = \$50,300
$$
</div>

**FCFE Calculation:**
<div style="background-color: #F5F5F5; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;">
$$
\text{FCFE} = \text{CFO} - \text{FCInv} + \text{Net Borrowing}
$$

$$
\text{FCFE} = \$50,000 - \$0 + \$5,000 = \$55,000
$$
</div>

**Check using FCFF:**
<div style="background-color: #F5F5F5; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;">
$$
\text{FCFE} = \text{FCFF} - [\text{Int} \times (1 - \text{Tax Rate})] + \text{Net Borrowing}
$$

$$
\text{FCFE} = \$50,300 - [\$500 \times (1 - 0.40)] + \$5,000
$$

$$
\text{FCFE} = \$50,300 - \$300 + \$5,000 = \$55,000
$$

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.3 Cash Flow Ratios: Performance & Coverage Metrics üìä</span>

These ratios use cash flow data (mainly CFO) to provide insights comparable to traditional income-statement or balance-sheet ratios.

**Performance Ratios (How well is cash generated?):**

* **Cash Flow-to-Revenue:** $\text{CFO} / \text{Net Revenue}$ (Measures cash generated per dollar of sales)
* **Cash Return-on-Assets (CROA):** $\text{CFO} / \text{Average Total Assets}$ (Measures cash generated relative to asset base)
* **Cash Return-on-Equity (CROE):** $\text{CFO} / \text{Average Total Equity}$ (Measures cash generated relative to equity base)
* **Cash-to-Income:** $\text{CFO} / \text{Operating Income}$ (Compares cash flow to operating profit)
* **Cash Flow per Share:** $(\text{CFO} - \text{Preferred Dividends}) / \text{Weighted Avg. Common Shares}$ (Cash flow available per common share)

**Coverage Ratios (Can cash flows cover obligations?):**

* **Debt Coverage:** $\text{CFO} / \text{Total Debt}$ (Ability to pay off debt using operating cash flow)
* **Interest Coverage (Cash Basis):** $(\text{CFO} + \text{Interest Paid} + \text{Taxes Paid}) / \text{Interest Paid}$ (Ability to pay interest using cash generated before interest and taxes)
* **Reinvestment:** $\text{CFO} / \text{Cash Paid for Long-term Assets}$ (Ability to acquire assets using operating cash flow)
* **Debt Payment:** $\text{CFO} / \text{Cash Long-term Debt Repayment}$ (Ability to repay debt principal using operating cash flow)
* **Dividend Payment:** $\text{CFO} / \text{Dividends Paid}$ (Ability to pay dividends using operating cash flow)
* **Investing and Financing Coverage:** $\text{CFO} / \text{Cash Outflows from Investing & Financing Activities}$ (Ability of CFO to cover discretionary outflows)

#### <span style="color: #00838F;">2.4 Global & Local Context üåç</span>

* **Global Example:** A mature, high-dividend company like Coca-Cola might have a high **Dividend Payment Ratio** (CFO / Dividends Paid), indicating its operations comfortably generate enough cash to fund its dividends. Its **Reinvestment Ratio** (CFO / CapEx) might be lower than a growth company's, showing less need to plow cash back into massive expansion.
* **Indian Example:** A heavily indebted Indian infrastructure company like GMR Infra might be closely watched on its **Debt Coverage Ratio** ($CFO / Total\ Debt$) and **Interest Coverage Ratio** ($(CFO + Int Paid + Tax Paid) / Int Paid$). A low or declining ratio could signal distress. Conversely, a high-growth tech company like Zomato, while potentially unprofitable, might show strong **Cash Flow-to-Revenue** if its unit economics are improving and working capital management is efficient, even if its FCFE is negative due to heavy reinvestment.

### üéØ Quick Exam-Day Pointers

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">
* **Analyze, Don't Just Read:** Look for patterns in CFO, CFI, CFF across time and compare to peers. Consider the company's life cycle stage.
* **CFO is Key:** Is it positive and sustainable? Does it come from core operations or unsustainable working capital changes? How does it compare to Net Income (Earnings Quality)?
* **CFI Shows Investment:** High CapEx = Growth? Asset Sales = Restructuring or Cash Need?
* **CFF Shows Funding:** Where does cash come from (Debt/Equity)? Where does it go (Repayments/Dividends/Buybacks)?
* **FCF = Discretionary Cash:** Know FCFF (for all investors) vs. FCFE (for equity holders). Master the formulas, especially starting from CFO. Remember to adjust interest for FCFF.
* **Common-Size is Your Friend:** Use % of Revenue (or % of Inflows/Outflows) to spot trends and compare companies, removing size distortion.
* **Cash Flow Ratios Matter:** Use performance ratios (like Cash ROE) and coverage ratios (like Debt Coverage) to gain deeper insights than income/balance sheet ratios alone.
