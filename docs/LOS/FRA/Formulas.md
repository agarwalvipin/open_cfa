# FRA Formulas Organization Guide
Welcome to your comprehensive guide for organizing and memorizing the key formulas in Financial Reporting and Analysis (FRA) for the CFA Level I exam. This structure is designed to help you categorize and retain the essential formulas you'll need for success.
## üèóÔ∏è Structure for Organizing FRA Formulas

**1. Income Statement Analysis** üìä
* **Revenue Recognition:** (Focus on concepts, less on formulas here, but know the 5 steps).
* **Expense Recognition:** (Matching Principle, Capitalization vs. Expensing effects).
* **Earnings Per Share (EPS):**
    * Basic EPS: `(Net Income - Preferred Dividends) / Weighted Avg. Common Shares Outstanding`
    * Diluted EPS (Concept): Adjust numerator (add back interest/pref dividends) and denominator (add potential shares) for dilutive securities.
    * *Quick Dilution Checks:* (Pref Div / Shares Created), (Convertible Debt Interest (1-t) / Shares Created), Treasury Stock Method Shares.
* **Profitability Margins:**
    * Gross Profit Margin: `Gross Profit / Revenue` 
    * Operating Profit Margin: `Operating Profit (or EBIT) / Revenue` 
    * Pretax Margin: `Earnings Before Tax / Revenue` 
    * Net Profit Margin: `Net Income / Revenue` 

---

**2. Balance Sheet Analysis** ‚öñÔ∏è
* (Mainly conceptual: Intangibles, Goodwill, Financial Instruments, Leases).
* **Common-Size Balance Sheet:** `Account Item / Total Assets` 

---

**3. Cash Flow Statement Analysis** üåä
* **CFO (Indirect Method Framework):** `CFO = NI + NCC - WCInv +/- Adjustments for Gains/Losses` 
    * *Remember CAL Rule for WCInv: Assets Opposite, Liabilities Same*.
* **CFO (Direct Method Concepts):** Cash Collected from Customers, Cash Paid to Suppliers, etc.
* **Free Cash Flow (FCF):**
    * FCFF (from NI): `NI + NCC + [Int * (1-Tax Rate)] - FCInv - WCInv` 
    * FCFF (from CFO): `CFO + [Int * (1-Tax Rate)] - FCInv` 
    * FCFE: `CFO - FCInv + Net Borrowing` 
* **Cash Flow Ratios:** (See Ratio Analysis below).

---

**4. Analysis of Inventories** üì¶
* **COGS Calculation:** `Beg. Inventory + Purchases - End. Inventory` 
* **LIFO/FIFO Adjustments (Inflation):**
    * `FIFO Inventory = LIFO Inventory + LIFO Reserve`
    * `FIFO COGS = LIFO COGS - Change in LIFO Reserve`
    * `FIFO NI ‚âà LIFO NI + Change in LIFO Reserve * (1 - Tax Rate)`
    * `FIFO Retained Earnings ‚âà LIFO Retained Earnings + LIFO Reserve * (1 - Tax Rate)`
* **Lower of Cost or NRV/Market:** (Conceptual application).

---

**5. Analysis of Long-Term Assets** üè≠
* **Capitalization vs. Expensing Effects:** (Conceptual impact on statements/ratios).
* **Depreciation/Amortization:** (SL, Accelerated Methods - basic concepts).
* **Impairment:** (Conceptual tests under IFRS vs. GAAP).
* **Derecognition (Asset Sales):** `Gain/Loss = Sales Proceeds - Book Value` 
* **Asset Age/Life Ratios:**
    * Average Age: `Accumulated Depreciation / Annual Depreciation Expense` 
    * Total Useful Life: `Historical Cost (Gross PP&E) / Annual Depreciation Expense` 
    * Remaining Useful Life: `Ending Net PP&E / Annual Depreciation Expense` 

---

**6. Analysis of Long-Term Liabilities & Equity** üè¶
* **Leases (Lessee - Finance Lease):** Calculate PV of payments for initial Asset/Liability. Track Interest Expense and Principal Repayment. ROU Asset amortized (usually SL).
* **Bonds:** (Amortized cost concepts for discount/premium).
* **Pensions:** (Focus on Funded Status = Fair Value Plan Assets - PBO/PVDBO).
* **Share-Based Comp:** (Conceptual expensing over vesting period).

---

**7. Analysis of Income Taxes** üßæ
* **Income Tax Expense:** `Taxes Payable + Change in DTL - Change in DTA` 
* **Effective Tax Rate:** `Income Tax Expense / Pretax Income (EBT)` 
* **Statutory Tax Rate:** Rate set by law.
* **Cash Tax Rate:** `Cash Taxes Paid / Pretax Income (EBT)` 

---

**8. Financial Analysis Techniques (Ratio Analysis)** ‚öôÔ∏è
* **Activity Ratios:**
    * Inventory Turnover: `COGS / Average Inventory` 
    * Days of Inventory on Hand (DOH): `365 / Inventory Turnover` 
    * Receivables Turnover: `Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable` 
    * Days of Sales Outstanding (DSO): `365 / Receivables Turnover` 
    * Payables Turnover: `Purchases / Average Accounts Payable` 
    * Number of Days of Payables: `365 / Payables Turnover` 
    * Working Capital Turnover: `Revenue / Average Working Capital` 
    * Fixed Asset Turnover: `Revenue / Average Net Fixed Assets` 
    * Total Asset Turnover: `Revenue / Average Total Assets` 
* **Liquidity Ratios:**
    * Current Ratio: `Current Assets / Current Liabilities` 
    * Quick Ratio: `(Cash + Marketable Securities + Receivables) / Current Liabilities` 
    * Cash Ratio: `(Cash + Marketable Securities) / Current Liabilities` 
    * Defensive Interval: `(Cash + Mkt Sec + Rec) / Avg Daily Expenditures` 
    * Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC): `DOH + DSO - Number of Days of Payables` 
* **Solvency Ratios:**
    * Debt-to-Assets: `Total Debt / Total Assets` 
    * Debt-to-Capital: `Total Debt / (Total Debt + Total Equity)`
    * Debt-to-Equity: `Total Debt / Total Equity` 
    * Financial Leverage: `Average Total Assets / Average Total Equity` 
    * Interest Coverage: `EBIT / Interest Expense` 
    * Fixed Charge Coverage: `(EBIT + Lease Payments) / (Interest Expense + Lease Payments)` 
* **Profitability Ratios:**
    * (Margins covered under Income Statement).
    * Return on Assets (ROA): `Net Income / Average Total Assets` or `[NI + Int Exp*(1-t)] / Avg Tot Assets` 
    * Operating ROA: `Operating Income (EBIT) / Average Total Assets` 
    * Return on Total Capital (ROTC): `EBIT / Average Total Capital` (Avg Debt + Avg Equity) 
    * Return on Equity (ROE): `Net Income / Average Total Equity` 
    * Return on Common Equity: `(Net Income - Preferred Dividends) / Average Common Equity` 

---

**9. DuPont Analysis** üß©
* **Basic (3-Part):** `ROE = (NI / Revenue) * (Revenue / Avg Assets) * (Avg Assets / Avg Equity)`
    * `ROE = Net Profit Margin * Asset Turnover * Financial Leverage` 
* **Extended (5-Part):** `ROE = (NI / EBT) * (EBT / EBIT) * (EBIT / Revenue) * (Revenue / Avg Assets) * (Avg Assets / Avg Equity)`
    * `ROE = Tax Burden * Interest Burden * EBIT Margin * Asset Turnover * Financial Leverage`

**Memorization Tips:**
* **Understand, Don't Just Rote:** Know *why* a formula works and what it tells you.
* **Categorize:** Use this structure (or adapt it) to group formulas logically.
* **Flashcards:** Digital or physical cards with the formula name/purpose on one side and the formula on the other.
* **Active Recall:** Cover the formula and try to write it from memory based on its name/purpose.
* **Practice Problems:** The BEST way! Applying formulas in QBank questions cements them. Start without looking, then check.
* **Focus on Key Ratios:** Not all ratios are tested equally. Know the main ones (Turnovers, Liquidity, Solvency, Margins, ROE, DuPont) cold.

Good luck! Break it down, practice consistently, and you'll get them. üëç
