## Reading 75: Valuing a Derivative Using a One-Period Binomial Model üå≥

-----

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">üéØ Introduction</span>

Imagine you're at a fork in the road where a path splits into two‚Äîone goes up a hill, the other goes down. You know exactly where each path leads. The **one-period binomial model** is a lot like that! It's a powerful tool that simplifies a complex world by assuming an asset's price can only move to one of two possible values in the next period: up or down. By knowing these two potential outcomes, we can perfectly calculate what an option is worth today. This reading will show you two ways to do this: by building a risk-free portfolio and by using a clever shortcut called risk-neutral pricing.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 1: Valuing an Option with Two Possible Futures (LOS 75.a)</span>

The core idea here is **replication** and **no-arbitrage**. We can create a portfolio of the underlying stock and a loan that perfectly mimics the option's payoffs. Since the portfolio and the option have identical future payoffs, they must have the same price today. Otherwise, a risk-free profit opportunity (arbitrage) would exist.

To do this, we need to build a risk-free (perfectly hedged) portfolio. The key ingredient is the **hedge ratio (h)**, which tells us how many shares of the underlying asset we need to hold for each option we write to make our portfolio's value immune to the stock's movement.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.1 Valuing a Call Option</span>

Let's say we want to find the value of a European call option. We'll create a portfolio by buying `h` shares of the stock and selling one call option.

* **Goal:** Make the portfolio's value the same whether the stock price goes up or down.
* **Portfolio Value at Expiration:**
  * If price goes up: $V^+ = hS^+ - c^+$
  * If price goes down: $V^- = hS^- - c^-$
* **Hedge Ratio Formula:** To make $V^+ = V^-$, the hedge ratio must be:

  <div style="background-color: #F5F5F5; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;">
  
  $$h = \frac{c^+ - c^-}{S^+ - S^-}$$
  
  </div>

Since this portfolio is now risk-free, its return must be the **risk-free rate ($R_f$)**.

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

**üßÆ Example Time!**
- An HDFC Bank stock is currently trading at **$S_0 = \$50$**. In one period, it can either go up to **$S^+ = \$60$** or down to **$S^- = \$42$**. We want to value a call option with an exercise price of **$X = \$55$**. The risk-free rate is **3%**.
- **Step 1:** Find Option Payoffs:
  - If stock goes up to $60: c^+ = \text{Max}(0, 60 - 55) = \$5$.
  - If stock goes down to $42: c^- = \text{Max}(0, 42 - 55) = \$0$.
- **Step 2:** Calculate Hedge Ratio (h):
  - $h = \frac{5 - 0}{60 - 42} = \frac{5}{18} = 0.278$
  - Buy 0.278 shares for every 1 call option sold.
- **Step 3:** Portfolio's Future Value:
  - "Up" state: $V^+ = (0.278 \times \$60) - \$5 = \$16.68 - \$5 = \$11.68$
- **Step 4:** Discount to Find Today's Value:
  - $V_0 = \frac{\$11.68}{1.03} = \$11.34$
- **Step 5:** Solve for the Call Price ($c_0$):
  - $V_0 = hS_0 - c_0$
  - $\$11.34 = (0.278 \times \$50) - c_0$
  - $\$11.34 = \$13.90 - c_0 \implies c_0 = \$2.56$
- **Result:** The fair price of the call option today is **$2.56**.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.2 Valuing a Put Option</span>

The process for a put option is almost identical, but our hedged portfolio consists of buying `h` shares and **buying** one put option.

* **Hedge Ratio Formula:** The formula for `h` is the same:

  <div style="background-color: #F5F5F5; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;">
  
  $$h = \frac{p^+ - p^-}{S^+ - S^-}$$
  
  </div>

<div style="background-color: #E3F2FD; border-left: 5px solid #1976D2; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

**üí° CFA Exam Tip ‚úçÔ∏è:** Notice the hedge ratio for a put will be negative. This means you should *short* `h` shares for every put option you buy to create the risk-free hedge. For the exam, focus on understanding the *process* of creating a risk-free portfolio and discounting its value.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 2: Risk-Neutral Pricing (LOS 75.b)</span>

**Risk-neutral pricing** is a powerful and elegant alternative. It's a mathematical shortcut that says, "Since we can build a perfect hedge, we don't need to worry about an investor's risk appetite. We can just pretend everyone is risk-neutral." 

In this pretend world, the expected return on any asset is simply the risk-free rate. We use this idea to calculate **risk-neutral probabilities** (often shown as $\pi$), which are pseudo-probabilities that make this true.

The valuation process becomes simpler:
1. Calculate the option's payoffs if the price goes up ($c^+$) or down ($c^-$).
2. Calculate the risk-neutral probabilities for the up-move ($\pi_{up}$) and down-move ($\pi_{down}$).
3. Calculate the expected value of the option's payoff: $E(\text{Payoff}) = (\pi_{up} \times c^+) + (\pi_{down} \times c^-)$.
4. Discount this expected value back to today at the risk-free rate.

<div style="background-color: #F5F5F5; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;">

$$c_0 = \frac{(\pi_{up} \times c^+) + (\pi_{down} \times c^-)}{1 + R_f}$$

</div>

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

**üßÆ Example with Risk-Neutral Probabilities!**
- A stock is at **$S_0 = \$30$**. It can go up to **$S^+ = \$34.50$** or down to **$S^- = \$26.10$**. The risk-free rate is **7%**. We want to value a call option with **X = $30**.
- **Step 1:** Find Option Payoffs:
  - $c^+ = \text{Max}(0, 34.50 - 30) = \$4.50$
  - $c^- = \text{Max}(0, 26.10 - 30) = \$0$
- **Step 2:** Calculate Risk-Neutral Probabilities:
  - $\pi_{up} = \frac{(1+R_f)S_0 - S^-}{S^+ - S^-} = \frac{(1.07 \times 30) - 26.10}{34.50 - 26.10} = \frac{6}{8.4} = 0.715$
  - $\pi_{down} = 1 - 0.715 = 0.285$
- **Step 3:** Find Expected Future Value:
  - $E(\text{Payoff}) = (0.715 \times \$4.50) + (0.285 \times \$0) = \$3.22$
- **Step 4:** Discount to Find Today's Value:
  - $c_0 = \frac{\$3.22}{1.07} = \$3.01$
- **Result:** The fair price of the call option today is **$3.01**.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">üß™ Formula Summary</span>

<div style="background-color: #F5F5F5; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;">

**Hedge Ratio (h):**

$$h = \frac{\text{Payoff}^+ - \text{Payoff}^-}{\text{Underlying}^+ - \text{Underlying}^-}$$

</div>

<div style="background-color: #F5F5F5; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;">

**Risk-Neutral Probability (Up-move):**

$$\pi_{up} = \frac{(1+R_f)S_0 - S^-}{S^+ - S^-}$$

</div>

<div style="background-color: #F5F5F5; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;">

**Option Value using Risk-Neutral Probabilities:**

$$C_0 = \frac{\pi_u \times C_u + \pi_d \times C_d}{1 + r}$$

</div>

Where:
- $C_0$ = Option value today
- $\pi_u$ = Risk-neutral probability of up move
- $\pi_d$ = Risk-neutral probability of down move  
- $C_u$ = Option payoff if price goes up
- $C_d$ = Option payoff if price goes down
- $r$ = Risk-free rate

### üéØ Quick Exam-Day Pointers

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

* **Binomial Model:** Values an option using **no-arbitrage** principles. Assumes the underlying's price can only go to one of two known values in the next period.
* **Method 1: Replication ‚Üí** Create a risk-free portfolio by combining the underlying asset and the option. The key is calculating the **hedge ratio (h)**. The value of this risk-free portfolio, discounted at the risk-free rate, allows you to solve for the option's price.
* **Method 2: Risk-Neutral Pricing ‚Üí** Mathematical shortcut. Calculate special **risk-neutral probabilities** and use them to find the expected payoff of the option. Then, discount that expected payoff at the **risk-free rate**.
* **Risk-Neutral:** Doesn't describe investors; it's a technique that works *because* of the no-arbitrage principle. You're valuing the derivative in a hypothetical world where its expected return is the risk-free rate.
