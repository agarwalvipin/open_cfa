## Reading 66: Derivative Instrument and Derivative Market Features üìà

### üéØ Introduction

Welcome, future charterholder, to the world of derivatives! This reading is the essential foundation for all the derivative topics to come (forwards, futures, options, and swaps). Think of this as the "What and Where" guide.

  * **What** is a derivative? (LOS 66.a)
  * **Where** are they traded? (LOS 66.b)

Many candidates find derivatives intimidating, but they are just contracts. Their value is simply *derived* from something else. By the end of this summary, you'll have a rock-solid understanding of their basic features and the two main markets where they live. Let's get started\!

-----

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 1: What *is* a Derivative? (LOS 66.a)</span>

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.1 The Core Definition üß¨</span>

A **derivative** is a security that **derives its value** from the value or return of another asset or variable.

That "something else" is called the **underlying**. The underlying can be almost anything:

  * A stock or a stock index
  * A bond or an interest rate 
  * A commodity (like gold or oil) 
  * A currency exchange rate 

A simple example is a **forward contract**. Imagine you (the **buyer**) agree to buy 100 shares of Acme stock from a **seller** in three months at a fixed price of `$30` per share. This `$30` is the **forward price**.

  * **If the stock price at settlement is `$35`:** You (the buyer) win\! You get to buy `$35` shares for only `$30`. You have a `$5` gain, and the seller has a `$5` loss.
  * **If the stock price at settlement is `$25`:** The seller wins. You (the buyer) are *obligated* to buy `$25` shares for `$30`. You have a `$5` loss, and the seller has a `$5` gain.

This is a **zero-sum game**. The buyer's profit always equals the seller's loss.

People use derivatives for two main reasons:

1.  **Hedging (to manage risk) üõ°Ô∏è:** This is using a derivative to *reduce* or eliminate an existing risk.

    > **Example:** A farmer who will have wheat to sell in 6 months is worried the price will fall. She **sells wheat futures** today to lock in a sales price, *hedging* her price risk.

2.  **Speculating (to take on risk) ‚öîÔ∏è:** This is using a derivative to bet on a future price movement, effectively *creating* risk in hopes of a profit.

    > **Example:** A trader with `$0` in his pocket believes oil prices will skyrocket. He **buys oil futures**, taking on massive risk in the hopes of a big payday.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.3 Advantages Over "Cash Market" Trades üöÄ</span>

Why use a derivative instead of just buying the underlying asset (known as a "cash market" transaction)?

  * **High Leverage:** You can gain exposure to `$1,000,000` worth of S&P 500 stocks by buying futures with very little (or no) money down.
  * **Lower Transaction Costs:** It's much cheaper to buy one S&P 500 future than it is to buy all 500 underlying stocks.
  * **Ease of Short Selling:** It's operationally much simpler to sell a future (a short position) than to go through the process of borrowing a stock to sell it short.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">1.4 Common Underlyings üåç</span>

  * **Financials:** Stocks, bonds, interest rates, and currencies.
  * **Commodities:**
      * **Hard Commodities:** Natural resources that are mined (e.g., gold, oil).
      * **Soft Commodities:** Grown or ranched (e.g., wheat, cattle).
  * **Credit Derivatives:** These derive their value from the creditworthiness of a borrower. The most famous is the **Credit Default Swap (CDS)**, which is essentially an insurance policy on a bond defaulting.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 2: The Two Arenas - ETD vs. OTC (LOS 66.b)</span>

Derivatives are traded in two distinct types of markets.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.1 Exchange-Traded Derivatives (ETD) - The "Public Stadium" üèüÔ∏è</span>

These are derivatives (like **futures**) that trade on a formal exchange, just like stocks.

  * **Standardized Contracts:** The exchange sets all the terms: what the underlying is, the contract size, and the expiration date. It's "one size fits all".
  * **High Liquidity & Transparency:** It's easy to get in and out of a position, and all prices are public.
  * **The "Referee":** The exchange has a **Central Clearinghouse (CCH)** that guarantees all trades.

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

**üí° Key Concept: The Central Clearinghouse (CCH)**

This is the most important feature of exchange-traded markets. The CCH **eliminates counterparty risk** (the risk that the other side of your trade will default).

It does this in two ways:

1.  **Novation:** The CCH steps into the middle of every trade. It becomes the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer. You no longer care about the person you traded with; your only counterparty is the CCH.
2.  **Margin:** The CCH requires *both* parties to deposit cash (called **margin**) as collateral to cover potential losses.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.2 Over-the-Counter (OTC) Derivatives - The "Bespoke Suit Shop" tailoring</span>

These are private, custom-made contracts negotiated directly between two parties (e.g., a corporation and an investment bank).

  * **Custom Instruments:** You get *exactly* what you want. Need to hedge $13.7 million of jet fuel for delivery on May 28th? No problem. An exchange can't do that.
  * **Flexibility:** The parties set all the terms.
  * **Counterparty Risk:** This is the massive downside. It's a private agreement. If your counterparty goes bankrupt, you're just another creditor in line and may not get paid.
  * **Less Liquid & Opaque:** Since it's a custom contract, you can't easily sell it to someone else. Prices are private, not public.

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.3 Head-to-Head: ETD vs. OTC</span>

| Feature | Exchange-Traded (ETD) | Over-the-Counter (OTC) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Contract** | **Standardized**  | **Customized**  |
| **Counterparty Risk** | **None.** Backed by CCH. | **High.** Depends on the counterparty. |
| **Liquidity** | **High**  | **Low**  |
| **Transparency** | **High** (public prices)  | **Low** (private prices)  |
| **Margin** | Required for all  | May not be required (depends on negotiation). |
| **Regulation** | More regulated  | Less regulated (traditionally)  |

#### <span style="color: #6A1B9A;">2.4 The Blurring Line: Central Clearing Mandates ü§ù</span>

After the 2008 financial crisis (which was fueled by OTC derivatives), regulators stepped in.

  * Today, many common OTC derivatives (like standard interest rate swaps) are *required* by law to be processed through a **central clearinghouse**.
  * This brings the primary benefit of ETDs (no counterparty risk) to the OTC market, reducing the risk of a systemic collapse.

### üéØ Quick Exam-Day Pointers

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

  * A derivative's value is **derived** from an **underlying** asset.
  * **Hedging** = Reducing risk (shield). **Speculating** = Adding risk (sword).
  * Key advantages of derivatives are **leverage**, **low transaction costs**, and **ease of short selling**.
  * **ETD = Standardized, Cleared, Liquid, Transparent**. Think: Futures.
  * **OTC = Custom, Counterparty Risk, Illiquid, Opaque**. Think: Forwards, Swaps.
  * The **Central Clearinghouse (CCH)** uses **novation** (becoming the counterparty to all trades) and **margin** to eliminate counterparty risk in ETD markets.
  * Remember that new **central clearing mandates** are forcing many *OTC* contracts to be cleared, blurring the lines between the two markets.
