### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 1: Standard III(A) - Loyalty, Prudence, and Care 🛡️</span>

**The Standard:** "Members and Candidates have a duty of **loyalty** to their clients and must act with reasonable **care** and exercise prudent **judgment**. Members and Candidates must act for the benefit of their clients and place their clients' interests before their employer's or their own interests." 

This is the heart of your vow.

  * **Loyalty:** Your client's interests come first. Period. This means their interests are *also* ahead of your employer's.
  * **Prudence:** You must act with the "care, skill, and diligence that a reasonable person acting in a like capacity" would use.
  * **Care:** You must act in a judicious manner to avoid harming your client.

#### 1.1 First, Identify Your "Client"

This is a classic exam trap. The "client" is the person or entity to whom you owe the duty.

  * **Individual Clients:** This is easy—it's the person you advise.
  * **Pension Plans/Trusts:** This is the trick. The **client is the beneficiaries of the plan** (the future retirees), *not* the company or the manager who hired you. (See Example 1: Wiley violated this by buying his company's stock for the pension plan to fend off a takeover, benefiting the managers, not the beneficiaries ).
  * **Index Funds:** When managing to a mandate (like an S\&P 500 fund), your duty is to invest in a manner consistent with the stated mandate.

#### 1.2 Key Battlegrounds for Loyalty

  * **Soft Commissions ("Soft Dollars"):** This is when you use client brokerage (commissions) to "pay" for research services.
      * **The Rule:** This is a *client* asset. You can *only* use soft dollars to purchase research that **directly benefits the client**.
      * **The Violation:** You *cannot* use client commissions to pay for things that benefit your firm (like rent, computer hardware, or non-research-related travel). This is a breach of loyalty.
      * You are still obligated to seek **"best price" and "best execution"** for your client's trades.
  * **Proxy Voting:** Voting proxies is part of managing a client's assets. Proxies have economic value, and you have a duty to vote them in an informed and responsible manner that benefits the client, not blindly with management.

**🧠 Memory Aid: The "L-P-C" Vow**

  * **L**oyalty: Clients > Employer > You.
  * **P**rudence: Act with skill.
  * **C**are: Don't harm.

Remember, for a pension plan, the "Client" is the **B**eneficiaries, **N**ot the **B**oss.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 2: Standard III(B) - Fair Dealing ⚖️</span>

**The Standard:** "Members and Candidates must deal **fairly and objectively** with all clients when providing investment analysis, making investment recommendations, taking investment action, or engaging in other professional activities." 

#### 2.1 Fairly vs. Equally

This is the most important distinction in this standard.

  * **"Fairly" does NOT mean "Equally."**  You cannot possibly call all 1,000 of your clients at the exact same second.
  * **Different Service Levels:** You *can* offer premium services (like more in-depth reports or more personal contact) to clients who pay higher fees.
  * **The Catch:** These different service levels must be **disclosed to all clients and prospective clients** and must be available to everyone (not offered selectively). A lower-fee service level *must not* disadvantage or harm those clients.

#### 2.2 Key Battlegrounds for Fairness

  * **Disseminating Recommendations:** You must ensure *all* clients have a "fair opportunity to act" on a recommendation.
      * **VIOLATION:** Telling your best clients about a "buy" recommendation *before* you release the report to all clients (Example 1).
  * **Trade Allocation (Especially IPOs):** This is a massive exam topic. When a new issue (like an IPO) is "hot" (oversubscribed), you must have a fair system to allocate the limited shares.
      * **The Rule:** Allocate shares **pro rata** (based on order size) to all *suitable* clients.
      * **Family/Personal Accounts:**
          * You must **forgo any sales to yourself** or your immediate family *unless* they are fee-paying clients.
          * If your family members *are* fee-paying clients, their accounts must be treated like **any other client account**—no better, and *no worse*. (See Example 7: Allocating to family *last* is a violation, just as allocating to them *first* would be ).

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 3: Standard III(C) - Suitability 🎯</span>

**The Standard:** "1. When Members and Candidates are in an **advisory relationship** with a client, they must:
a. Make a reasonable **inquiry** into... investment experience, risk and return objectives, and financial constraints... **prior to** making any recommendation... and must **reassess and update** this information regularly.
b. Determine that an investment is **suitable**...
c. Judge suitability in the context of the **client's total portfolio**.
2\. When... managing a portfolio to a specific **mandate**,... they must make only... actions that are **consistent with the stated objectives**... of the portfolio." 

This standard has two distinct paths:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start: What is your role?] --> B{Advisory Relationship? (e.g., Financial Advisor)};
    B -- Yes --> C[MUST create an IPS];
    C --> D[1. Make reasonable inquiry into client's situation (risk, return, etc)];
    D --> E[2. Judge investments in context of TOTAL portfolio];
    E --> F[3. UPDATE the IPS regularly (at least annually)];
    
    B -- No --> G{Managing to a Mandate? (e.g., Fund Manager)};
    G -- Yes --> H[MUST invest *only* in a way that is consistent with the stated mandate];
    H --> I[E.g., A 'Large-Cap Income Fund' CANNOT buy speculative, zero-dividend stocks (Example 4)];
```

#### 3.1 The Bedrock: The Investment Policy Statement (IPS)

For any advisory relationship, your first duty is to gather client information *before* doing anything. This info is codified in a **written Investment Policy Statement (IPS)**.

The IPS must contain:

  * Risk Tolerance 
  * Return Requirements 
  * **Constraints:**
      * Time Horizon 
      * Liquidity Needs 
      * Tax Concerns 
      * Legal/Regulatory Factors 
      * Unique Needs (e.g., ESG preferences, as in Example 7) 

**Crucially:** The IPS is a *living document*. It must be reviewed and updated **at least annually**, or whenever a client's material circumstances change (e.g., inheritance, job loss).

#### 3.2 Unsolicited Trade Requests

What if a risk-averse client *demands* you buy a speculative stock that violates their IPS?

1.  **Refrain & Discuss:** Do not make the trade. First, discuss with the client *why* it is unsuitable.
2.  **Educate:** Explain how the trade deviates from the agreed-upon IPS.
3.  **If Client Insists:** If the trade will *not* materially impact the total portfolio, you may execute it after the discussion. If it *will* materially impact the portfolio, you should update the IPS with the client.
4.  **Final Step:** If the client *repeatedly* insists on unsuitable trades, you must evaluate whether you can continue to serve them.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 4: Standard III(D) - Performance Presentation 📊</span>

**The Standard:** "When communicating investment performance information, Members and Candidates must make reasonable efforts to ensure that it is **fair, accurate, and complete**." 

This standard is designed to prevent you from misleading clients about your own (or your firm's) performance.

<div style="background-color: #F3E5F5; border-left: 5px solid #7B1FA2; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

**💡 The Gold Standard: GIPS®**

The *best* way to comply with Standard III(D) is for your firm to claim compliance with the **Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS)**. If you do this, you are automatically meeting your obligations.

</div>
</div>

If your firm *does not* comply with GIPS, you must *at a minimum*:

  * **No "Cherry-Picking":** Present the performance of a **composite** (a group) of similar portfolios, not a single "representative account".
  * **Include Terminated Accounts:** You *must* include the performance of accounts that have left the firm. Leaving out your failures is misleading.
  * **Disclose Key Facts:** You must disclose:
      * If performance is **simulated** (backtested).
      * If performance is **gross** or **net** of fees.
      * If the performance record is from a **prior firm** (Example 3).
  * **Maintain Records:** You must keep the data used to calculate your performance.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 5: Standard III(E) - Preservation of Confidentiality 🔒</span>

**The Standard:** "Members and Candidates must keep information about **current, former, and prospective** clients confidential..." 

This is your vow of silence. It applies to *everyone*—even people who didn't hire you (prospective) and people who fired you (former).

#### 5.1 The THREE Sacred Exceptions

This is one of the most-tested parts of the entire Code. You *must* keep info confidential **UNLESS**:

1.  The information concerns **illegal activities** by the client.
2.  Disclosure is **required by law** (e.g., a court order or government officials).
3.  The client or prospective client **permits disclosure**.

<div style="background-color: #E3F2FD; border-left: 5px solid #1976D2; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

**💡 Special Case: CFA Institute Investigations**

This is *not* a violation. Standard III(E) **does not** prevent you from cooperating with a CFA Institute Professional Conduct (PC) investigation. In fact, you are *required* to cooperate with PC, and failing to do so is a separate violation.

### 🎯 Quick Exam-Day Pointers

  * **III(A) - Loyalty:** Client > Employer > You. For pensions, the client = beneficiaries. Soft dollars must benefit the client.
  * **III(B) - Fair Dealing:** **Fairly, not equally.** You can have premium services if disclosed to *all*. For IPOs, allocate *pro rata* and treat family *client* accounts like any other client.
  * **III(C) - Suitability:** The **IPS** is king. It must be written and **updated at least annually**. If you manage a fund, stick to the **mandate**.
  * **III(D) - Performance:** Must be **Fair, Accurate, and Complete.** Complying with **GIPS** is the best way. Don't cherry-pick; *always* include terminated accounts.
  * **III(E) - Confidentiality:** Keep it secret\! This applies to **current, former, and prospective** clients.
  * **III(E) Exceptions (Know these\!):** You *can* talk if: 1) Client is **illegal**, 2) **Law** requires it, or 3) Client gives **permission**. Cooperating with a CFA investigation is *not* a violation.
