### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 1: Standard IV(A) - Loyalty 🤝</span>

**The Standard:** "In matters related to their employment, Members and Candidates must act for the benefit of their employer and not deprive their employer of the advantage of their skills and abilities, divulge confidential information, or otherwise cause harm to their employer." 

This standard means you must be a trustworthy and loyal employee. You can't engage in any activity that would "injure the firm, deprive it of profit, or deprive it of the member’s or candidate’s skills and ability." 

#### 1.1 Leaving Your Employer: The Most-Tested Area

This is the critical battleground for Standard IV(A). You are free to seek other employment, but you must not breach your duty of loyalty *while you are still employed*.

**What you CANNOT do *while employed*:**

  * **Solicit Clients:** You must not solicit or "promote" your new employer to your current firm's clients *before* you leave.
  * **Take Property:** You cannot take any employer records or files, period. This includes:
      * Client lists.
      * Copies of research reports or supporting documents.
      * Computer models or algorithms.
      * This applies to hard copies, files on your personal computer, or any other medium. All work done for your employer is your employer's property.
  * **Disparage Your Employer:** You cannot disparage your current firm to clients in an attempt to get them to follow you (Example 4).

**What you CAN do *while employed*:**

  * You are "generally free" to make preparations to go into a competitive business *as long as* those preparations do not breach your duty of loyalty.
  * For example, you can register a new company with regulators, but you cannot start soliciting clients or competing.

**What you CAN do *after you leave*:**

  * You *can* contact clients from your previous firm, **BUT** you must use publicly available information (like a phone directory or LinkedIn) to get their contact info. You cannot use a stolen client list.
  * You *can* use the **skills, knowledge, and experience** you gained at your old firm. These belong to you.
  * (This is all assuming you did not sign a non-compete agreement, which is a separate legal matter) .

#### 1.2 Other Key Loyalty Issues

  * **Independent Business:** If you plan to start an independent business (a "side hustle") that *competes* with your employer, you **must** notify your employer and get their consent *before* doing so.
  * **Social Media:** Be careful. Accounts created for firm business are firm property. It's best practice to keep personal and professional accounts separate. Simply updating your LinkedIn profile *after* you leave to show your new job is *not* a violation (Example 9).
  * **Whistle-Blowing (The Exception):** Your duty to the market and your clients is **higher** than your duty to your employer. If your employer is engaged in illegal or unethical activity, you may be justified in acting contrary to their interests (e.g., "whistle-blowing") **if** your intent is to protect clients or market integrity, *not* for personal gain.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 2: Standard IV(B) - Additional Compensation Arrangements 💰</span>

**The Standard:** "Members and Candidates must not accept gifts, benefits, compensation, or consideration that competes with or might reasonably be expected to create a conflict of interest with their **employer’s interest** unless they obtain **written consent from all parties** involved." 

This standard is about managing conflicts with your *employer*, just as Standard I(B) was about managing conflicts with your *clients*.

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

**💡 Exam Tip: Standard I(B) vs. IV(B)**

  * **Standard I(B) (Objectivity):** A *company* offers you a gift to influence your research. This is a conflict with your **clients**.
  * **Standard IV(B) (This one):** A *client* offers you a bonus or gift for good performance (Example 1). This is a conflict with your **employer**.
  * **Why?** Your employer needs to know. This "side-pay" could tempt you to favor that one client over other clients (e.g., give them more time, better trade allocations), which harms the employer's business and other clients.

**The Rule:** If you are offered *any* additional compensation or benefit (cash or non-cash, like a vacation or a gym membership) for your services, you **must**:

1.  **Inform your employer** of the proposed arrangement *in writing*.
2.  Describe the nature of the compensation and its duration.
3.  Obtain **written permission** from your employer *before* you accept.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 3: Standard IV(C) - Responsibilities of Supervisors 🧑‍✈️</span>

**The Standard:** "Members and Candidates must make **reasonable efforts** to ensure that anyone subject to their supervision or authority complies with applicable laws, rules, regulations, and the Code and Standards." 

If you are a manager, team lead, or compliance officer, this standard is for you. You are responsible for the conduct of those you supervise.

#### 3.1 Your Two-Fold Duty: Prevent & Detect

You must make "reasonable efforts" to both **prevent** and **detect** violations by your team.

This requires you to:

1.  **Establish an Effective Compliance System:** You must ensure your firm has adequate, written compliance procedures.
2.  **Educate Your Team:** You must ensure your team is trained on these procedures and the Code.
3.  **Enforce the System:** You must monitor your employees' actions to ensure they are following the rules.

#### 3.2 What to Do If You Find a Violation

  * You must **promptly initiate an investigation**.
  * Relying on an employee's "assurance" that it won't happen again is **not enough**.
  * You must take steps to ensure the violation won't be repeated, such as **increasing supervision** or **placing limits** on the employee's activities.

#### 3.3 The "Inadequate System" Trap

This is a critical point. What if your *firm's* compliance system is terrible?

  * You have a duty to bring the inadequate system to the attention of senior management and recommend corrective action.
  * If your firm *refuses* to fix the system and you feel you cannot adequately discharge your supervisory duties, you **must decline supervisory responsibility in writing** until the firm adopts reasonable procedures.

### 🎯 Quick Exam-Day Pointers

  * **IV(A) - Loyalty:** This is all about **leaving your job**. Don't solicit clients or take *any* firm property (lists, models) *before* you leave. After you leave, you can compete fairly using public info.
  * **IV(B) - Extra Pay:** Got offered a bonus from a client? A trip? You **must** get **written consent from your employer** first. This is a conflict with your *employer's* interests.
  * **IV(C) - Supervisors:** Your job is to **PREVENT and DETECT** violations. If you find one, you *must* investigate. If your firm's system is broken and they won't fix it, you *must* **decline to supervise** in writing.
