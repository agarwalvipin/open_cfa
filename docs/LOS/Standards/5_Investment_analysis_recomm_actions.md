### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 1: Standard V(A) - Diligence and Reasonable Basis 🧐</span>

**The Standard:** "Members and Candidates must:

1.  Exercise **diligence, independence, and thoroughness** in analyzing investments, making investment recommendations, and taking investment actions. 
2.  Have a **reasonable and adequate basis**, supported by appropriate research and investigation, for any investment analysis, recommendation, or action." 

This standard demands that you "do your homework." Every recommendation you make must be backed by solid, defensible work. The level of diligence required will depend on your role and the product, but the principle is universal.

#### 1.1 Using Third-Party and Secondary Research

You don't have to do all the research yourself. You can rely on research from others, but you can't do so *blindly*.

  * **Secondary Research:** Research from others in your *own* firm.
  * **Third-Party Research:** Research from *outside* your firm (e.g., brokerage reports).

**The Rule:** You must make "reasonable and diligent efforts" to determine that such research is sound. This means you should review its **assumptions, rigor, timeliness, and objectivity** before relying on it.

#### 1.2 Quantitative Models (Quant Research)

This standard absolutely applies to "quants," backtesting, and algorithms.

  * **You MUST understand your model.** You don't have to be able to code it from scratch, but you *must* understand its assumptions, limitations, and how it works.
  * **Test your models\!** You must test the model's output before using it.
  * **Key Trap:** Your models must incorporate a broad range of assumptions, including **extremely negative scenarios**. Only testing with recent *positive* data is a violation (see Example 6).

#### 1.3 Selecting External Advisers (Subadvisers)

Hiring an outside manager for your client? Standard V(A) applies to that, too. You must review that subadviser with the same diligence you would a stock. This includes reviewing their code of ethics, compliance procedures, and investment process.

**💡 Key Exam Concept: Group Research**

What if you are on a research team and you *disagree* with the team's final recommendation?

  * You do **NOT** have to dissociate (i.e., remove your name from the report) **IF** you believe the team's consensus opinion has a "reasonable and adequate basis," even if it's not your personal opinion.
  * This shows that the standard is about a *reasonable process*, not about being "right" (see Example 3).

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 2: Standard V(B) - Communication with Clients 🗣️</span>

**The Standard:** "Members and Candidates must..."

1.  **Disclose** to clients... the **nature of the services** provided, along with information about the **costs**... 
2.  **Disclose**... the basic format and general principles of the **investment processes**... and must promptly disclose any **material changes**... 
3.  **Disclose**... significant **limitations and risks**... 
4.  Use reasonable judgment in identifying which **factors are important**... and include those factors in communications... 
5.  **Distinguish between fact and opinion**... 

This standard governs *how* you talk to clients. Your communications must be honest and complete so clients can make informed decisions.

#### 2.1 Disclosing Services and Costs

This is a critical part of the standard. Clients must understand what they are paying for.

  * You must clearly explain the *nature* of your services (what you *will* and *will not* do).
  * You must disclose *all* associated costs, even those from third parties.
  * This is an *ongoing* duty. You must update clients if the services or costs change.

#### 2.2 Disclosing Your Process, Risks, and Limitations

  * You must explain your basic investment process to clients.
  * Most importantly, you must **promptly disclose any material changes** to that process (e.g., switching from a simple model to a complex new one, as in Example 9).
  * You must inform clients of significant **risks** and **limitations** (e.g., "this strategy has limited capacity" or "this product is highly illiquid").

#### 2.3 The Classic Trap: Fact vs. Opinion

This is one of the most tested concepts in all of Standard V.

  * **Fact:** A verifiable piece of data. "The company's reported revenue last quarter was $100 million."
  * **Opinion:** A projection, estimate, or personal belief. "I project the company's revenue next quarter will be $110 million."

You **must** clearly separate these. Stating an *opinion* as a *fact* (e.g., "Based on the *fact* that the company has 500,000 ounces of gold to be mined...") is a clear violation (see Example 5).

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 3: Standard V(C) - Record Retention 📂</span>

**The Standard:** "Members and Candidates must develop and maintain **appropriate records** to support their investment analyses, recommendations, actions, and other investment-related communications with clients and prospective clients." 

This is your "paper trail." You must keep records to substantiate your work and the reasons for your actions. This applies to all forms of communication, including **emails, text messages, and social media posts**.

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

**🧠 Memory Aid: The "7-Year" Rule & Firm Property**

This is the most-tested part of Standard V(C).

1.  **Records are the FIRM'S PROPERTY:** All records you create as an employee (reports, models, notes) belong to your *employer*.
2.  **You CANNOT take them:** When you leave a job, you **cannot** take *any* records or copies without your employer's *express consent*.
3.  **You MUST recreate your work:** You cannot use old reports from a prior firm. You must recreate the supporting records at your new firm (using public data, not the stolen files).
4.  **Retention Period:** In the absence of any regulatory or firm guidance, CFA Institute **recommends** maintaining records for a minimum of **seven years**.

### 🎯 Quick Exam-Day Pointers

  * **V(A) - Diligence:** Your work must have a **reasonable basis**. This applies to your own analysis, third-party research, quant models, and when you select subadvisers.
  * **V(A) - Group Research:** You can *disagree* with a team report and *not* dissociate, as long as you believe the team's conclusion still has a reasonable basis.
  * **V(B) - Communication:** Disclose your investment process, its risks, and (new\!) the **nature and cost of your services**.
  * **V(B) - Fact vs. Opinion:** **NEVER** state an opinion (like a forecast) as a fact.
  * **V(C) - Records:** This is the big one. Records are your **FIRM'S PROPERTY**. You *cannot* take them when you leave. The recommended retention period is **7 years** if no other rule applies.
