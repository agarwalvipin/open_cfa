## Standard VII: Responsibilities as a CFA Institute Member or CFA Candidate

### üéØ Introduction

Congratulations on making it to the final standard! This one is a bit different. While the first six standards govern your day-to-day professional life, Standard VII, **Responsibilities as a CFA Institute Member or CFA Candidate**, is all about upholding the reputation and integrity of the organization you're a part of. üèÖ Think of it as the "Code of Conduct" for being a member of this elite global community. It covers how you must behave when involved in CFA Institute programs (like the exam you're studying for!) and how you can (and cannot) talk about your affiliation with the CFA designation and program. It‚Äôs all about protecting the brand and ensuring the letters "CFA" remain the global gold standard.

### Standard VII(A): Conduct as Participants in CFA Institute Programs ü§î

This standard is simple and direct: you must not engage in any conduct that compromises the **reputation or integrity of CFA Institute or the CFA designation** or the **integrity, validity, or security of the CFA Institute programs**.

This applies to all aspects of your participation, most notably the CFA exam itself.

What does this prohibit?
* **Cheating on the exam:** This is the most obvious violation. Giving or receiving help, using unauthorized materials, or trying to look at someone else's screen are all strictly forbidden.
* **Disclosing confidential exam information:** You cannot share what was on your exam with anyone. This includes discussing specific questions or topics with friends, posting them on online forums (like Reddit), or telling future candidates what to study. The integrity of the exam depends on it being a surprise for everyone.
* **Improperly using the CFA designation or other confidential program information.**
* **Misrepresenting your qualifications or credentials** to the CFA Institute.

#### **Global & Local Context üåç**

This standard is globally uniform. Whether you are taking the exam in Mumbai, New York, or Singapore, the rules are identical.

* **Example 1 (Violation ‚ùå):** After taking the Level 1 exam, a candidate in India posts on a public WhatsApp group: "Tough exam! Be sure to focus on the FIFO vs. LIFO accounting questions, there were at least five of them." This violates the standard by revealing specific topic coverage from the exam.
* **Example 2 (No Violation ‚úÖ):** A candidate tells a friend, "The Level 1 exam was challenging, and I'm glad I spent a lot of time on Ethics and FRA, just like the curriculum weighting suggests." This is acceptable. It's general advice and doesn't reveal any confidential exam questions or specific details.

> [!TIP]
> **CFA Exam Tip ‚úçÔ∏è:** This is as straightforward as it gets. **Do not cheat. Do not share exam specifics.** The CFA Institute takes this extremely seriously. Any violation can result in the voiding of your exam results, suspension from the program, and a permanent ban. It's not worth the risk.

### Standard VII(B): Reference to CFA Institute, the CFA Designation, and the CFA Program ‚öñÔ∏è

This standard governs how you can refer to your affiliation with the CFA Institute. The goal is to be accurate and not mislead people about your status or what the designation means.

**Key Rules for Candidates:**

* You **can** state that you are a candidate in the CFA Program.
* You **cannot** imply that being a candidate is a partial designation or that you have achieved something more than you have. You also cannot mention which level you are studying for or have passed.

**Key Rules for Charterholders:**

* Once you've passed all three exams, met the work experience requirement, and become a member, you can use the **Chartered Financial Analyst** or **CFA** marks after your name.
* The **CFA** mark must always be used *after* your name (e.g., "Anjali Sharma, CFA") or as an adjective (e.g., "She is a CFA charterholder"), not as a noun (e.g., "She is a CFA").
* You must not exaggerate what the designation means. It signifies competence and ethics, but it does not guarantee superior investment performance.

#### **Correct vs. Incorrect References ‚úÖ/‚ùå**

| Status | Statement | Correct? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Passed Level I | "I am a Level II candidate in the CFA Program." | ‚úÖ |
| Passed Level II | "I passed Level II of the CFA exam." | ‚úÖ |
| Passed Level II | "I am a CFA, Level II." | ‚ùå (Cannot imply a partial designation) |
| Charterholder | "John Doe, CFA" | ‚úÖ |
| Charterholder | "As a CFA, I can guarantee you will outperform the market." | ‚ùå (Cannot guarantee performance) |
| Charterholder | "My qualifications include the CFA charter." | ‚úÖ |

> [!TIP]
> **CFA Exam Tip ‚úçÔ∏è:** The exam loves to test the nuances of how you can refer to the program. Remember, as a candidate, you can state you are a candidate, but you cannot imply you've earned any sort of "mini-designation." For charterholders, the key is not to misrepresent the designation as a guarantee of success. It's a credential, not a magic wand.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### üéØ Quick Exam-Day Pointers
> * **Protect the Exam:** Your number one duty as a candidate is to protect the integrity of the exam. Don't cheat, and don't share confidential information. Period.
> * **Be Honest About Your Status:** As a candidate, you can say you're a candidate. Don't overstate your accomplishments.
> * **"CFA" is Not a Noun:** For charterholders, the designation is "CFA charterholder," and the marks "CFA" or "Chartered Financial Analyst" go *after* a name. You are a person who holds the charter; you are not "a CFA."
> * **No Guarantees:** The CFA charter is a mark of distinction in competence and ethics. It is **not** a guarantee of future investment performance, and you must never imply that it is.
