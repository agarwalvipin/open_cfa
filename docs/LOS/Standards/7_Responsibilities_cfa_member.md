Here it is, candidate—the final standard. You've learned your duties to your clients, your firm, and the market. **Standard VII: Responsibilities as a CFA Institute Member or CFA Candidate** is your direct pledge to CFA Institute itself.

This standard ensures that the credential you are working so hard to earn maintains its value. It's about protecting the integrity of the exams, the reputation of the institute, and the honesty of how you represent your affiliation. This is the code that binds all of us together.

Let's master these final two responsibilities.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 1: Standard VII(A) - Conduct as Participants in CFA Institute Programs 🛡️</span>

**The Standard:** "Members and Candidates must not engage in any conduct that compromises the reputation or integrity of CFA Institute or the CFA designation or the **integrity, validity, or security** of CFA Institute programs." 

This standard's main purpose is to protect the CFA exams and all other CFA Institute programs. This means **NO CHEATING** in any form.

#### 1.1 Prohibited Conduct (The "Do Nots")

This standard explicitly prohibits:

  * **Giving or receiving assistance** on any CFA exam.
  * **Violating any exam rules** or testing policies.
  * **Disregarding security measures** (e.g., refusing a proctor's request, as in Example 3) , 3371.
  * **Filing a fraudulent deferral request** or misrepresenting information to CFA Institute , 3361.
  * **Using your volunteer position** at CFA Institute or a local society for personal or professional gain (e.g., scheduling only your own clients to speak, as in Example 10) , 3412.

#### 1.2 The "Confidentiality" Trap: What You CANNOT Talk About

This is the most-tested part of Standard VII(A). After you take the exam, you are **prohibited** from disclosing confidential information.

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

**💡 Exam Tip: What is "Confidential Exam Information"?**

You **CANNOT** share or solicit:

  * Specific details of any exam question.
  * Broad topical areas tested or *not* tested (e.g., "There were tons of derivatives questions\!" or "I was surprised there were no questions on IPO allocations").
  * Formulas you were, or were not, asked to use.

You **CAN** share:

  * Your opinion on the exam's difficulty or how well you think you did.
  * Your study strategies or recommendations.
  * Your *personal opinion* about CFA Institute's policies (this standard doesn't prohibit disagreement).

**The Bottom Line:** Do *not* post about exam content on blogs, forums, or social media. This compromises the integrity of the exam for future candidates.

### <span style="color: #1565C0;">Part 2: Standard VII(B) - Reference to CFA Institute, the CFA Designation, and the CFA Program ®,</span>

**The Standard:** "When referring to CFA Institute, CFA Institute membership, the CFA designation, or candidacy in the CFA Program, Members and Candidates must not **misrepresent or exaggerate** the meaning or implications..." 

This standard is all about *how* you refer to your status. You must be 100% factual and honest.

#### 2.1 The CFA Designation (for Charterholders)

  * **Fact:** Earning the charter requires passing three rigorous exams, meeting work experience requirements, and pledging to follow the Code and Standards.
  * **Proper Reference:** "Becoming a charterholder has enhanced my portfolio management skills." 
  * **IMPROPER Reference:** "CFA charterholders achieve better performance results." 
  * **The Cardinal Sin:** You **cannot** imply the designation guarantees *superior performance* or *better results*.
  * **Membership is MANDATORY:** You only have the right to use the "CFA" marks if you are a **current, dues-paying member** of CFA Institute. If your membership lapses, you *must* stop using "CFA" on your cards, resume, and social media , 3484.

#### 2.2 Candidacy in the CFA Program (for Candidates)

This is the most common trap for candidates on the exam.

<div style="color: #000000; font-weight: 500;">

**💡 How to (and NOT to) Refer to Your Candidacy**

You are a candidate if you are enrolled to sit for an exam or are awaiting your results.

| **PROPER References (Factual)** | **IMPROPER References (A Violation)** |
| :--- | :--- |
| "I am a 20XX Level III candidate for the CFA designation."  | "CFA, Level II" (Implies a partial designation)  |
| "I passed the Level II CFA exam."  | "CFA, Expected 20XX" (You can't predict your charter)  |
| "I passed all three levels... and will be eligible for the charter upon completion of the required work experience."  | "John Smith, Charter Pending" (There is no such status)  |
| "I passed all three exams in three consecutive sittings." (This is a fact)  | "I am among the elite, having passed all three exams in three attempts." (This *exaggerates* and implies superior ability)  |

### 🎯 Quick Exam-Day Pointers

  * **VII(A) - Conduct:** **Protect the exam\!** Don't cheat, and don't share *anything* about exam content—specific questions, topics covered, or topics *not* covered.
  * **VII(A) - Volunteers:** Don't use your volunteer role at CFA Institute to benefit yourself or your clients.
  * **VII(B) - References:** Be **100% factual**.
  * **VII(B) - The Cardinal Sin:** You **CANNOT** link the CFA designation to **superior investment performance**.
  * **VII(B) - Membership:** You **must** be a current, paid-up member to use the "CFA" marks. Lapsed membership = no right to use the designation.
  * **VII(B) - Candidates:** **NEVER** use "CFA, Level I/II" or "CFA, Expected..." on a resume or business card. This implies a partial designation and is a direct violation.
