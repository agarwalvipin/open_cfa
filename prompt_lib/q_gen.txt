Sarah is a CFA candidate working as a junior analyst at an investment bank.

According to CFA Institute's Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct, what is Sarah's most appropriate course of action?

- A) Follow her supervisor's instructions as he is more experienced.
- B) Resign from her position immediately to avoid any association with unethical behavior.
- C) Refuse to comply with her supervisor's request and report the issue to a higher authority within the firm or to the CFA Institute if necessary.

<summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: C**

  **Explanation:**

  Standard I(A) Knowledge of the Law requires CFA members and candidates to understand and comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and the CFA Institute Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct. In case of conflict, the more strict rule applies. Sarah has a responsibility to uphold the integrity of capital markets and protect client interests, which outweighs following unethical instructions from a supervisor. She should first attempt to address the issue within her firm through proper channels. If that fails, reporting to the CFA Institute might be necessary.
