  Which phase of the business cycle is characterized by real GDP ceasing to decline and starting to expand?

  - A) Peak
  - B) Trough
  - C) Contraction

  <details>
  <summary>âœ… Answer & Explanation</summary>

  **Correct Answer: B**

  **Explanation:**

  * **B is correct** because the trough is the lowest point of a business cycle. It marks the end of the contraction phase and the beginning of the expansion (or recovery) phase. At this point, real GDP stops falling and begins to rise.
  * **A is incorrect** because the peak is the highest point of a business cycle, where real GDP stops expanding and begins to decline.
  * **C is incorrect** because a contraction is the entire phase during which real GDP is declining from its peak.
