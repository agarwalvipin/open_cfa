I am preparing for my CFA level 1 exam.
Generate audio overview for "Reading 14: Fiscal Policy" only.
keep the pace of conversation slow and often repeat the concept just discussed so that the listener can follow easily.
try to add CFA tips wherever applicable and highlight important topics and concepts that may be important for exam.
add real life examples to explain the concepts.
since this is a global exam, it is important to cover global context.
It would be nice if you can use Indian context to explain these.
Do not use Kaplan and schweiser keywords
