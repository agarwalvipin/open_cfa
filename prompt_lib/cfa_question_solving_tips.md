# CFA Exam Question‑Solving Playbook

## 1 ⟶ Universal exam‑day habits

| Habit | Why it matters | How to execute |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| **Work the vignette backwards** | The stem and options show you where the answer hides in the vignette. | Skim the 2‑4 linked items first, highlight keywords (*least likely*, dates), then read the vignette purpose‑fully. |
| **Annotate on first pass** | Saves time when you loop back. | Circle calc inputs, box LOS verbs, mark “?” beside unsure answers. |
| **90‑second myth** | Weighting differs by item type. | Bank time on short conceptual items; spend surplus on heavy calc & Ethics. |
| **Two‑pass rule** | Prevents time sinks. | Pass 1: answer/guess in < 30 s; Pass 2: revisit flagged items. |
| **Answer everything** | No negative marking. | If blind, pick the mid‑range number or the longest verbal choice. |

## 2 ⟶ Format‑specific tactics (Aligned with `cfa_q_format.md`)

Below each header, the first bullet tells you what the CFA Institute is testing, the second gives a diagnostic lens, and the third is a lightning‑quick execution tip.

### 1. Most Likely
- **What’s tested:** Highest‑probability outcome or the action that best fits the Code.
- **Lens:** Eliminate clearly wrong options first; weigh remaining choices against CFA guidance hierarchy (laws → Standards → Firm policy).
- **Execute:** Ask, *“If I briefed a client, which choice keeps me safest?”*—that’s usually correct.

### 2. Least Likely
- **What’s tested:** The single exception among generally true statements.
- **Lens:** Flip mindset—look for logical or factual breaks in the pattern.
- **Execute:** Physically mark each option T/F in the margin; the lone “F” is your answer.

### 3. Best Describes / Most Appropriate
- **What’s tested:** Nuance and completeness in concepts/definitions.
- **Lens:** Rank options from most to least comprehensive.
- **Execute:** Favor the statement that captures *all* material elements with balanced wording.

### 4. Except
- **What’s tested:** Identification of an incorrect attribute.
- **Lens:** Similar to “least likely” but explicitly signals **EXCEPT**—underline it twice.
- **Execute:** Turn the prompt into a true/false checklist; circle the false item.

### 5. Definition / Terminology Recognition
- **What’s tested:** Pure recall of key terms (Quant, FRA, Fixed Income heavy).
- **Lens:** Trigger sheet memory—recall textbook phrasing.
- **Execute:** If two answers look close, pick the one that matches CFA Glossary wording most closely.

### 6. Cause‑and‑Effect Reasoning
- **What’s tested:** Logical chain reactions in markets and economics.
- **Lens:** Draw a 3‑box flow (Cause → Mechanism → Effect) on scratch paper.
- **Execute:** Validate direction (⇧/⇩) first; half the distractors invert the sign.

### 7. Calculation‑Based Questions
- **What’s tested:** Formula application under time pressure.
- **Lens:** Template keystrokes + ball‑park estimates.
- **Execute:** Write inputs → eyeball magnitude → punch once. Aim <120 s per calc.

### 8. Comparative Questions
- **What’s tested:** Differences between instruments, strategies, or outcomes.
- **Lens:** Build a mental “X vs Y” table (traded/exchange‑cleared, customized, settled daily, etc.).
- **Execute:** The attribute unique to one side is usually the key.

### 9. Ethics Scenario Questions
- **What’s tested:** Application of Code & Standards to real‑world vignettes.
- **Lens:** Four‑P lens (Process → Priority → Public → Performance) + absolutist language filter.
- **Execute:** Identify the **first** standard violated; choose remedy that adds a preventive step.

## 3 ⟶ 5‑minute daily drill ⟶ 5‑minute daily drill

1. Pick one fresh Learning Outcome Statement.
2. Write a DIY CSS question.
3. Build one NUM calculation with new numbers.
4. Draft a 30‑word SCJ Ethics scenario.
5. Answer all within 4 min.

Repeat daily and the exam will feel like muscle memory.
