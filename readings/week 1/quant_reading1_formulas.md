*   **Interest Rate:** Real risk-free rate + Inflation premium + Default risk premium + Liquidity premium + Maturity premium

*   **Holding Period Return (HPR):** $\frac{\text{Ending value} - \text{Beginning value}}{\text{Beginning value}} = \frac{P_1 - P_0 + D_1}{P_0}$
    *   Where:
        *   $P_1$ = Price received for the investment
        *   $P_0$ = Original purchase price of the investment
        *   $D_1$ = Cash flow received from the investment at time 1

*   **Arithmetic Mean:** $\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i}{N}$
    *   Where:
        *   $X_i$ = Individual return in the series
        *   $N$ = Number of returns in the series

*   **Geometric Mean:** $\left[ \prod_{i=1}^{N} (1 + R_i) \right]^{1/N} - 1$
    *   Where:
        *   $R_i$ = Individual return in the series
        *   $N$ = Number of returns in the series
    *   Alternatively, it can be expressed as: $[(1 + R_1) \times (1 + R_2) \times ... \times (1 + R_N)]^{1/N} - 1$

*   **Harmonic Mean:** $\frac{N}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{X_i}}$
    *   Where:
        *   $X_i$ = Individual value in the series
        *   $N$ = Number of values in the series

*   **Annualized Return (shorter than one year):** $(1 + HPR)^{(365/\text{Number of days in holding period})} - 1$

*   **Annualized Return (longer than one year):** $(1 + HPR)^{(1/\text{Number of years in holding period})} - 1$

*   **Present Value (PV) of a future cash flow:** $\frac{FV}{(1 + r)^N}$
    *   Where:
        *   $FV$ = Future Value
        *   $r$ = Periodic interest rate
        *   $N$ = Number of periods

*   **Continuously Compounded Return (from HPR):** $\ln(1 + HPR)$
    *   Where:
        *   $\ln$ = Natural logarithm
        *   $HPR$ = Holding Period Return

*   **Continuously Compounded Return (from price relative):** $\ln \left( \frac{\text{Ending Price}}{\text{Beginning Price}} \right)$

*   **Real Return (approximate):** Nominal return - Inflation rate

*   **Leveraged Rate of Return:** $r + \left( \frac{V_B}{V_0} \right) \times (r - r_B)$
    *   Where:
        *   $r$ = Return on the unleveraged investment
        *   $V_0$ = Investor's initial investment
        *   $V_B$ = Amount borrowed
        *   $r_B$ = Interest rate on the borrowed amount
