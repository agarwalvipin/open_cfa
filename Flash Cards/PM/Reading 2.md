What does capital market theory address?;It explains how portfolios of risky and risk-free assets are combined and valued and introduces the Capital Market Line.;Portfolio Mgmt LM2

What is the Capital Market Line (CML)?;The CML is the line representing portfolios combining the risk-free asset and the market portfolio, showing the highest expected return for each level of risk.;Portfolio Mgmt LM2 CML

What is the equation for the Capital Market Line (CML)?;\(E(R_p) = R_f + \frac{E(R_m) - R_f}{\sigma_m} \sigma_p\)<br>\(R_f\): risk-free rate; \(E(R_m)\): market return; \(\sigma_p\): portfolio standard deviation.;Portfolio Mgmt LM2 CML Eqn

How does leverage affect the position on the CML?;Leverage allows investors to borrow at the risk-free rate to create portfolios above the market portfolio on the CML, increasing both expected return and risk.;Portfolio Mgmt LM2 Leverage CML

What is systematic risk?;Risk inherent to the entire market or a market segment—cannot be diversified away, also known as market risk or non-diversifiable risk.;Portfolio Mgmt LM2 Systematic Risk

What is nonsystematic risk?;Risk unique to a particular company or industry—can be reduced through diversification, also called specific, unique, or diversifiable risk.;Portfolio Mgmt LM2 Nonsystematic Risk

What is the total risk of an asset?;Total risk is the sum of systematic (market) risk and nonsystematic (specific) risk.;Portfolio Mgmt LM2 Total Risk

What is the formula for total variance using a single-index model?;\(\sigma_i^2 = \beta_i^2 \sigma_M^2 + \sigma_{\epsilon i}^2\)<br>Total variance = systematic variance + nonsystematic variance.;Portfolio Mgmt LM2 Var Single-Index

What does beta (\(\beta\)) measure in the context of a stock or portfolio?;Beta measures the sensitivity of a security’s returns to movements in the market portfolio’s returns (systematic risk).;Portfolio Mgmt LM2 Beta

How is beta (\(\beta\)) calculated?;\(\beta_i = \frac{\text{Cov}(R_i, R_M)}{\sigma_M^2}\)<br>Covariance of asset with market divided by variance of market returns.;Portfolio Mgmt LM2 Beta Calc

What is the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) formula?;\(E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_i [E(R_M) - R_f]\)<br>Expected return equals risk-free rate plus beta times the market risk premium.;Portfolio Mgmt LM2 CAPM

What is the Security Market Line (SML)?;A graphical representation of the CAPM showing the relationship between expected return and beta for any security.;Portfolio Mgmt LM2 SML

What are the assumptions of the CAPM?;Investors are rational and risk-averse, markets are frictionless, all investors have homogeneous expectations, and can borrow/lend at the risk-free rate.;Portfolio Mgmt LM2 CAPM Assumptions

What is the Sharpe Ratio, and its formula?;\(\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{E(R_p) - R_f}{\sigma_p}\)<br>Measures risk-adjusted return relative to total portfolio risk.;Portfolio Mgmt LM2 Sharpe Ratio

What is the Treynor Ratio, and its formula?;\(\text{Treynor Ratio} = \frac{E(R_p) - R_f}{\beta_p}\)<br>Measures risk-adjusted return to systematic (market) risk.;Portfolio Mgmt LM2 Treynor Ratio

How is Jensen’s Alpha defined?;Alpha = actual portfolio return minus expected return by CAPM; shows value added by active management.;Portfolio Mgmt LM2 Jensen Alpha

What is M\(^2\) (Modigliani measure)?;Modifies the Sharpe Ratio to express risk-adjusted return in terms of percentage return—allows direct comparison with benchmark or market.;Portfolio Mgmt LM2 M2 RAP

What is the implication of CAPM for portfolio construction?;Investors should only be compensated for bearing systematic risk, as nonsystematic risk can be diversified away.;Portfolio Mgmt LM2 CAPM Implication

What is an active portfolio?;A portfolio constructed deliberately to differ from the market, in an attempt to beat market returns.;Portfolio Mgmt LM2 Active Portfolio

What is a passive portfolio?;A portfolio designed to replicate a market index, assuming market efficiency; manager makes no attempt to outperform the index.;Portfolio Mgmt LM2 Passive Portfolio
