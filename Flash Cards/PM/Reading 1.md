What is the difference between historical mean return and expected return?;Historical mean return is the average return actually earned in the past, while expected return is what investors anticipate in the future.;Portfolio Mgmt LM1
What is the formula for expected return, including risk-free rate, inflation, and risk premium?;\(1 + E(R) = (1 + r_{rF}) \times (1 + E(\pi)) \times (1 + E(RP))\)<br>Expected return factors in real risk-free rate, expected inflation, and expected risk premium.;Portfolio Mgmt LM1
What is the "risk–return trade-off"?;The positive relationship between expected risk and expected return—higher return over long-term requires accepting higher risk.;Portfolio Mgmt LM1
What are the mean annual geometric returns for large US company stocks and small US company stocks from 1926–2017?;Large company stocks: 10.2%, Small company stocks: 12.1% (annualized geometric mean).;Portfolio Mgmt LM1 Asset Class Returns
How is risk measured for US asset classes?;Risk is measured by annualized standard deviation of returns.;Portfolio Mgmt LM1
Which US asset class had the highest risk and which had the lowest risk from 1926–2017?;Small company stocks: highest risk (31.7%), Treasury bills: lowest risk (3.1%).;Portfolio Mgmt LM1 Asset Class Risk
What is risk aversion in finance?;Risk aversion refers to the preference for a certain (guaranteed) outcome over a risky outcome with the same expected return.;Portfolio Mgmt LM1 Risk Aversion
What is utility in the context of portfolio selection?;Utility measures relative satisfaction an investor derives from a portfolio and can be ranked but not compared between people.;Portfolio Mgmt LM1 Utility Theory
What is the formula for utility of an investment?;\(U = E(r) - \frac{1}{2}A\sigma^2\)<br>Where \(A\) is the risk aversion coefficient, \(E(r)\) is expected return, \(\sigma^2\) is variance.;Portfolio Mgmt LM1 Utility Formula
For what value of \(A\) is an investor risk-neutral using the utility formula?;\(A = 0\)<br>Risk-neutral investors care only about return, not risk.;Portfolio Mgmt LM1
What shape do indifference curves have for risk-averse investors?;Indifference curves are convex and slope upward (more risk requires higher return for the same utility).;Portfolio Mgmt LM1 Indifference Curve
What is the capital allocation line (CAL)?;A line showing all possible combinations of a risk-free asset and a risky asset, tracing out expected return for various risk levels.;Portfolio Mgmt LM1 CAL
How do correlations among assets affect portfolio risk?;Lower correlations between assets reduce the overall risk (standard deviation) of the portfolio.;Portfolio Mgmt LM1 Correlation Diversification
State the formula for the expected return of a portfolio of two assets.;\(E(R_p) = w_1 E(R_1) + w_2 E(R_2)\)<br>Where \(w_i\) is weight and \(E(R_i)\) is expected return of asset i.;Portfolio Mgmt LM1 Portfolio Return
State the formula for the variance of a two-asset portfolio.;\(\sigma_p^2 = w_1^2 \sigma_1^2 + w_2^2 \sigma_2^2 + 2w_1 w_2 \rho_{12} \sigma_1 \sigma_2\)<br>\(\rho_{12}\) is the correlation coefficient.;Portfolio Mgmt LM1 Portfolio Variance
What is the effect of diversification on portfolio risk?;Diversification reduces portfolio risk unless all assets are perfectly correlated (\(\rho = 1\)).;Portfolio Mgmt LM1 Diversification
What is kurtosis in return distributions?;Kurtosis (fat tails) is the higher-than-normal probability of extreme returns, increasing risk beyond mean–variance framework.;Portfolio Mgmt LM1 Kurtosis
What is the bid-ask spread?;The difference between the buying price (bid) and selling price (ask) of a security; affects trading cost and liquidity.;Portfolio Mgmt LM1 Liquidity
When is it appropriate to evaluate investments using only mean and variance?;When returns are normally distributed and markets are informationally and operationally efficient.;Portfolio Mgmt LM1 Mean-Variance
How is skewness relevant to asset returns?;Skewness indicates asymmetry—returns not symmetric around mean; negative skewness means more extreme negative outcomes.;Portfolio Mgmt LM1 Skewness
