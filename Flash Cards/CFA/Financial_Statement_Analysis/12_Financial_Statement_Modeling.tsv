<center><b>--- Financial Statement Modeling Basics ---</b></center>	<i>This section covers the purpose and general approach to building financial models.</i>	FSA::Module_12::Header
What is the primary purpose of a financial statement model?	A financial statement model is the starting point for most valuation models. It provides a structured forecast of a company's future financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement), from which valuation estimates can be made.	FSA::Module_12::Concept
What is the general approach to forecasting an income statement?	The process typically flows from top to bottom:<br>1. <b>Revenue Forecast:</b> The key driver of the model.<br>2. <b>Operating Expense Forecast:</b> Forecasting COGS, SG&A, etc., often as a percentage of revenue.<br>3. <b>Non-Operating Items Forecast:</b> Forecasting interest income/expense, taxes, and shares outstanding.	FSA::Module_12::Concept
How are revenue forecasts typically developed?	Revenue is forecasted for each business segment and is driven by projections for <b>volume</b> and <b>price/mix</b>.<br><br>These projections are based on historical trends, adjusted for expected deviations based on economic and industry analysis.	FSA::Module_12::Concept
How are COGS and Gross Margin typically forecasted?	COGS is often forecasted as a percentage of revenue, which directly implies a <b>gross profit margin</b> forecast. This margin forecast is based on historical margins, expected changes in price/mix, and input cost inflation.	FSA::Module_12::Concept
How are SG&A expenses typically forecasted?	SG&A expenses can be forecasted in several ways:<br>1. As a <b>percentage of revenue</b>, especially for variable components like distribution costs.<br>2. As a fixed amount with a specific <b>growth rate</b> for more stable components like administrative costs.	FSA::Module_12::Concept
How are net finance costs (interest expense and income) typically forecasted?	<b>Interest Expense:</b> Forecasted as an interest rate applied to the average debt balance from the balance sheet.<br><b>Interest Income:</b> Forecasted as an interest rate applied to the average cash & investment balance from the balance sheet.	FSA::Module_12::Concept
How are shares outstanding forecasted for EPS calculations?	The model typically assumes that the weighted average of basic and diluted shares outstanding remains flat or changes based on announced <b>share repurchase programs</b> or expected issuance for employee compensation.	FSA::Module_12::Concept
How is a pro forma statement of cash flows constructed?	It is built using data from both the historical statements and the forecasted income statement.<br>1. Start with <b>Net Income</b>.<br>2. Add back non-cash charges (like <b>D&A</b>).<br>3. Adjust for changes in <b>Working Capital</b>.<br>4. Forecast <b>Capital Expenditures (Capex)</b>.<br>5. Forecast <b>Financing Activities</b> (debt issuance/repayment, dividends, share repurchases).	FSA::Module_12::Concept
How is a pro forma balance sheet constructed?	The balance sheet is constructed by linking the other two statements. For example:<br><b>Ending Cash:</b> From the statement of cash flows.<br><b>Ending PPE:</b> Beginning PPE + Capex - Depreciation.<br><b>Ending Retained Earnings:</b> Beginning RE + Net Income - Dividends.

<center><b>--- Behavioral Factors in Forecasting ---</b></center>	<i>This section covers the common psychological biases that can affect analyst forecasts.</i>	FSA::Module_12::Header
What is Overconfidence Bias in forecasting?	The tendency for analysts to have unwarranted faith in their own abilities, leading them to create forecast confidence intervals that are too narrow.	FSA::Module_12::Definition
How can an analyst mitigate Overconfidence Bias?	1. <b>Scenario Analysis:</b> Create a range of forecast scenarios (base, upside, downside) to explicitly consider a wider range of outcomes.<br>2. <b>Track Past Forecasts:</b> Keep a detailed record of past forecasting successes and failures to develop a more realistic sense of one's own accuracy.	FSA::Module_12::Concept
What is Illusion of Control bias?	A bias where analysts overestimate their ability to control what cannot be controlled. This often manifests in creating overly complex and granular models in the belief that more detail equals more accuracy.	FSA::Module_12::Definition
What is Conservatism Bias in forecasting?	The tendency for analysts to maintain their prior views or forecasts by inadequately incorporating new information. This is also known as "anchoring and adjustment," where the adjustment from the prior forecast (the anchor) is too small.	FSA::Module_12::Definition
What is Representativeness Bias (and Base-Rate Neglect)?	The tendency to classify information based on past experiences, potentially ignoring the underlying base rate of a phenomenon.<br><br><b>Base-Rate Neglect</b> is focusing too much on new, specific information (the "inside view") and not enough on the long-term industry or sector averages (the "outside view").	FSA::Module_12::Definition
How can an analyst mitigate Representativeness Bias?	By explicitly considering the "outside view." Start the forecast using industry base rates (e.g., average margins, growth rates) and then justify any deviations based on company-specific factors.	FSA::Module_12::Concept
What is Confirmation Bias?	The tendency to look for and notice information that confirms one's prior beliefs, while ignoring or undervaluing information that contradicts them.	FSA::Module_12::Definition
How can an analyst mitigate Confirmation Bias?	Actively seek out information and opinions that are contrary to your own. For example, read research from analysts with a negative view on a stock or discuss the investment thesis with colleagues who disagree.	FSA::Module_12::Concept
<center><b>--- Competitive Factors, Inflation, and Long-Term Forecasting ---</b></center>	<i>This section covers advanced modeling topics.</i>	FSA::Module_12::Header
What are Porter's Five Forces?	A framework for analyzing industry competition to assess its structure and profitability.<br>1. Threat of Substitutes<br>2. Rivalry among Existing Competitors<br>3. Bargaining Power of Suppliers<br>4. Bargaining Power of Buyers<br>5. Threat of New Entrants	FSA::Module_12::Concept
How does industry structure affect forecasting prices and costs?	A favorable industry structure (e.g., low rivalry, high barriers to entry, low buyer/supplier power) allows incumbent companies to have greater <b>pricing power</b> and better control over costs, leading to higher and more stable profit margins.	FSA::Module_12::Concept
How does inflation affect revenue forecasts?	Forecasting revenue in an inflationary environment requires an understanding of the product's <b>price elasticity of demand</b>. If demand is inelastic, a company can pass on higher input costs to customers through higher prices, protecting its margins. If demand is elastic, raising prices could lead to a significant drop in sales volume.	FSA::Module_12::Concept
What is an explicit forecast horizon in a financial model?	The period of time (e.g., 5 or 10 years) for which the analyst makes detailed, year-by-year forecasts. After this period, a terminal value is typically calculated.	FSA::Module_12::Definition
What are "Normalized Earnings"?	The expected level of <b>mid-cycle earnings</b> for a company in the absence of any unusual or temporary factors (like a recession or a one-time gain). Normalized earnings are often used as the basis for calculating a terminal value.	FSA::Module_12::Definition
