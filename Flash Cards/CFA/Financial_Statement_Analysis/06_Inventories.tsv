How are inventories measured on the balance sheet under IFRS?	Inventories are measured at the lower of <b>cost</b> and <b>net realizable value (NRV)</b>.	FSA::Module_06::Rule
What is Net Realizable Value (NRV)?	The estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale and estimated costs to get the inventory in condition for sale.	FSA::Module_06::Definition
How are inventories generally measured under US GAAP?	Inventories are measured at the lower of <b>cost</b> or <b>market</b>. For inventory methods other than LIFO and retail, "market" is effectively the same as NRV.	FSA::Module_06::Rule
Under US GAAP (using LIFO or retail method), how is "market" value for inventory determined?	Market value is defined as the current replacement cost, subject to a ceiling and a floor:<br><b>Ceiling:</b> Net Realizable Value (NRV).<br><b>Floor:</b> NRV less a normal profit margin.	FSA::Module_06::Rule
Can inventory write-downs be reversed?	<b>Under IFRS:</b> Yes, reversals are permitted (up to the amount of the original write-down) if the value of the inventory recovers. The reversal is recognized as a reduction in the cost of sales.<br><br><b>Under US GAAP:</b> No, reversals of write-downs are prohibited.	FSA::Module_06::Comparison
What are the three main inventory cost flow assumptions (cost formulas)?	1. <b>First-In, First-Out (FIFO):</b> Assumes the first units purchased are the first ones sold.<br>2. <b>Last-In, First-Out (LIFO):</b> Assumes the last units purchased are the first ones sold. (Not permitted under IFRS).<br>3. <b>Weighted-Average Cost:</b> Averages the cost of all goods available for sale during the period.	FSA::Module_06::Definition
In a period of rising inventory costs, which method (FIFO or LIFO) results in higher net income?	<b>FIFO</b> results in higher net income because the lower (older) costs are recognized as COGS. LIFO results in lower net income because the higher (more recent) costs are recognized as COGS.	FSA::Module_06::Comparison
In a period of rising inventory costs, which method (FIFO or LIFO) results in a higher inventory balance on the balance sheet?	<b>FIFO</b> results in a higher inventory balance because the inventory on hand is valued at the more recent, higher costs. LIFO results in a lower inventory balance.	FSA::Module_06::Comparison
What is the LIFO Reserve?	The LIFO Reserve is the amount by which a company's inventory would be higher if it had used FIFO instead of LIFO. It is a required disclosure for US GAAP filers that use LIFO.<br><br>\[\text{FIFO Inventory} = \text{LIFO Inventory} + \text{LIFO Reserve}\]	FSA::Module_06::Definition::Formula
How can you adjust a LIFO company's COGS to a FIFO basis?	You can use the change in the LIFO reserve for the period.<br><br>\[\text{FIFO COGS} = \text{LIFO COGS} - (\text{Ending LIFO Reserve} - \text{Beginning LIFO Reserve})\]	FSA::Module_06::Formula
What is a "LIFO liquidation"?	A LIFO liquidation occurs when a company sells more inventory than it purchases during a period. This causes old, lower-cost inventory layers to be sold, resulting in an artificially high gross profit that is not sustainable.	FSA::Module_06::Definition
What does the Inventory Turnover ratio measure?	It measures how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period.<br><br>\[\text{Inventory Turnover} = \frac{\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\text{Average Inventory}}\]	FSA::Module_06::Formula
What does the Days of Inventory on Hand (DOH) ratio measure?	It measures the average number of days it takes for a company to sell its inventory.<br><br>\[\text{Days of Inventory on Hand (DOH)} = \frac{365}{\text{Inventory Turnover}}\]	FSA::Module_06::Formula
What are some key inventory disclosures required by accounting standards?	- The accounting policies used for measuring inventories (e.g., cost formula like FIFO).<br>- The total carrying amount of inventories, broken down by category (e.g., raw materials, work-in-progress, finished goods).<br>- The amount of any inventory write-downs recognized as an expense.<br>- The amount of any reversals of inventory write-downs (IFRS only).
