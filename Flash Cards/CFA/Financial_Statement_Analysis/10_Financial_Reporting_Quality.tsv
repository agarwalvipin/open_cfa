What are the three conditions that typically exist when low-quality financial reports are issued (the "fraud triangle")?	1. <b>Motivation (or Pressure):</b> Management is under pressure to meet certain performance targets (e.g., for bonuses, to avoid debt covenant violations, to support stock price).<br>2. <b>Opportunity:</b> Internal controls are weak, the board of directors is ineffective, or accounting standards allow for wide latitude.<br>3. <b>Rationalization:</b> Management is able to justify the low-quality reporting to themselves.

What is a key warning sign related to revenue recognition?	Revenue growing at a significantly faster rate than that of competitors or the industry, or revenue growth that is not accompanied by a corresponding growth in cash flow. A high or rapidly increasing Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) is a red flag.	FSA::Module_10::Concept
What is a key warning sign related to inventories?	Inventory growing at a significantly faster rate than sales. This could indicate obsolescence problems or that the company is overstating its inventory to boost profits. A low or declining inventory turnover ratio is a red flag.	FSA::Module_10::Concept
What is the relationship between cash flow and net income that can be a warning sign?	Net income that is consistently higher than cash flow from operations (CFO).

What is "channel stuffing"?	An aggressive revenue recognition practice where a company ships more product to its distributors than they are normally capable of selling.

What is a "bill-and-hold" transaction?	A transaction where a customer purchases goods, but requests that the seller hold them until a later date.

What is a "big bath" restructuring charge?	An aggressive accounting choice where a company overstates its restructuring charges in a period of already poor performance. This allows the company to "clean up" its balance sheet and makes future performance appear better.	FSA::Module_10::Definition
What are "cookie jar reserves"?	A conservative accounting choice where a company overstates its expenses and liabilities (e.g., allowance for bad debts) in good times. These "reserves" can then be released into earnings in bad times to smooth income.	FSA::Module_10::Definition
