What is the primary evaluation step for a mature, healthy company regarding its sources of cash?	To determine if <b>Cash Flow from Operating Activities (CFO)</b> is the primary source of cash, positive, and sufficient to cover capital expenditures.	FSA::Module_05::Concept
Why is the comparison between Cash Flow from Operating Activities (CFO) and Net Income important?	It is an indicator of <b>earnings quality</b>. For a mature company, CFO should ideally be greater than net income because net income includes non-cash expenses like depreciation.<br><br>If net income is consistently higher than CFO, it may signal aggressive or low-quality accrual accounting choices.	FSA::Module_05::Concept
What is Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF)?	FCFF is the cash flow available to <b>all of the company's capital providers</b> (both debt and equity holders) after paying for all operating expenses and necessary investments in capital.	FSA::Module_05::Definition
What is the formula for calculating Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) starting from CFO?	\[\text{FCFF} = \text{CFO} + \text{Interest expense}(1 - \text{Tax rate}) - \text{Fixed Capital Investment (FCInv)}\]<br><br><i>Note: FCInv is also known as capital expenditures. Interest is added back because it is a payment to a capital provider (debt holders).</i>	FSA::Module_05::Formula
What is Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE)?	FCFE is the cash flow available to the company's <b>common stockholders</b> after all operating expenses and borrowing costs (principal and interest) have been paid and necessary investments in capital have been made.	FSA::Module_05::Definition
What is the formula for calculating Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) starting from CFO?	\[\text{FCFE} = \text{CFO} - \text{Fixed Capital Investment (FCInv)} + \text{Net borrowing}\]<br><br><i>Note: Net borrowing is debt issued minus debt repaid.</i>	FSA::Module_05::Formula
What are the two primary methods for creating a common-size Statement of Cash Flows?	1. <b>Inflows/Outflows Approach:</b> Express each cash inflow as a percentage of total inflows, and each cash outflow as a percentage of total outflows.<br>2. <b>Net Revenue Approach:</b> Express each line item on the cash flow statement as a percentage of net revenue.	FSA::Module_05::Concept
What do cash flow performance (or profitability) ratios measure?	They measure a company's ability to generate cash from its operations.<br><br>Examples include:<br><b>Cash flow to revenue</b> (CFO / Net revenue)<br><b>Cash return on assets</b> (CFO / Average total assets)<br><b>Cash return on equity</b> (CFO / Average total equity)	FSA::Module_05::Concept
What do cash flow coverage ratios measure?	They measure a company's ability to cover its debt and other obligations.<br><br>Examples include:<br><b>Debt coverage</b> (CFO / Total debt)<br><b>Interest coverage</b> ([CFO + Interest paid + Taxes paid] / Interest paid)<br><b>Reinvestment</b> (CFO / Cash paid for long-term assets)	FSA::Module_05::Concept
What is the formula for the Debt Coverage Ratio (from cash flows)?	\[\text{Debt Coverage Ratio} = \frac{\text{CFO}}{\text{Total Debt}}\]<br><br>This ratio indicates a company's ability to repay its total debt using operating cash flow.	FSA::Module_05::Formula
What is the formula for the Reinvestment Ratio (from cash flows)?	\[\text{Reinvestment Ratio} = \frac{\text{CFO}}{\text{Cash paid for long-term assets (Capex)}}\]<br><br>This ratio measures a company's ability to acquire assets using operating cash flow. A ratio greater than 1.0 indicates no new financing is needed.	FSA::Module_05::Formula
What is the formula for the Cash Flow Interest Coverage Ratio?	\[\text{Interest Coverage Ratio} = \frac{\text{CFO} + \text{Interest paid} + \text{Taxes paid}}{\text{Interest paid}}\]<br><br>This measures the company's ability to meet its interest obligations. The numerator represents a proxy for pre-tax, pre-interest cash flow.	FSA::Module_05::Formula
