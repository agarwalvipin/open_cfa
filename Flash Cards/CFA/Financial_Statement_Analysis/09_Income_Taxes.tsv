FSA::Module_09::Comparison
What is the difference between income tax expense and income tax payable?	<b>Income Tax Expense</b> is the tax expense reported on the income statement. It includes both current and deferred tax.<br><b>Income Tax Payable</b> is the amount of tax that is actually payable to the tax authorities for the current period. It is reported as a liability on the balance sheet.	FSA::Module_09::Comparison
What are temporary differences in accounting for income taxes?	Temporary differences are differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability on the balance sheet and its tax base that will reverse in future periods. They give rise to deferred tax assets or liabilities.	FSA::Module_09::Definition
What are permanent differences in accounting for income taxes?	Permanent differences are differences between tax laws and accounting standards that will <b>not</b> reverse in the future. They do <b>not</b> give rise to deferred tax assets or liabilities but affect the effective tax rate. An example is a fine that is an expense for accounting but not deductible for tax.	FSA::Module_09::Definition
When is a Deferred Tax Liability (DTL) created?	A DTL is created when:<br>1. The carrying amount of an asset is greater than its tax base. (e.g., using accelerated depreciation for tax and straight-line for accounting)<br>2. The carrying amount of a liability is less than its tax base.<br>It implies that more tax will be paid in the future than is recognized in the current period's tax expense.	FSA::Module_09::Concept
When is a Deferred Tax Asset (DTA) created?	A DTA is created when:<br>1. The carrying amount of an asset is less than its tax base.<br>2. The carrying amount of a liability is greater than its tax base. (e.g., recognizing warranty expense for accounting before it is deductible for tax)<br>It implies that less tax will be paid in the future than is recognized. A DTA can also arise from tax loss carryforwards.	FSA::Module_09::Concept
What is a valuation allowance for a Deferred Tax Asset (DTA)?	A valuation allowance is a contra-asset account used to reduce the carrying value of a DTA. It is recognized if it is "more likely than not" (US GAAP) that some portion or all of the DTA will not be realized. IFRS has a similar concept but does not use the term "valuation allowance".	FSA::Module_09::Definition
How is Income Tax Expense calculated using tax payable and deferred tax items?	\[\text{Income Tax Expense} = \text{Taxes Payable} + \Delta\text{DTL} - \Delta\text{DTA}\]<br>Where:<br><b>ΔDTL</b> = Change in Deferred Tax Liabilities<br><b>ΔDTA</b> = Change in Deferred Tax Assets	FSA::Module_09::Formula
What is the Statutory Tax Rate?	The corporate income tax rate in the country in which the company is domiciled.	FSA::Module_09::Definition
What is the Effective Tax Rate?	The tax rate calculated as the reported income tax expense divided by the pretax income.<br><br>\[\text{Effective Tax Rate} = \frac{\text{Income Tax Expense}}{\text{Pretax Income}}\]	FSA::Module_09::Formula
What is the Cash Tax Rate?	The tax rate calculated as the cash tax paid in the period divided by the pretax income.<br><br>\[\text{Cash Tax Rate} = \frac{\text{Cash Tax Paid}}{\text{Pretax Income}}\]	FSA::Module_09::Formula
What is a tax rate reconciliation?	A disclosure, typically in the notes to the financial statements, that reconciles the difference between the statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate. It identifies the items that cause the two rates to differ, such as permanent differences, tax credits, and foreign tax rate differentials.	FSA::Module_09::Concept
How should an analyst treat a Deferred Tax Liability (DTL) that is not expected to reverse in the future?	If a DTL is not expected to reverse (i.e., it will not result in a future cash outflow), an analyst may treat it as <b>equity</b> for ratio analysis purposes rather than as a liability.	FSA::Module_09::Concept
What does a significant valuation allowance against a Deferred Tax Asset (DTA) imply about a company's future prospects?	It implies that management has doubts about the company's ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits of the DTA, which can be a negative signal about future profitability.
