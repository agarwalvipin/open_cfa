<center><b>--- The Financial Analysis Process ---</b></center>	<i>This section covers the framework and objectives of financial analysis.</i>	FSA::Module_11::Header
What are the key questions an analyst should clarify before beginning any financial analysis?	- What is the <b>purpose</b> of the analysis?<br>- What <b>level of detail</b> is needed?<br>- What <b>data are available</b>?<br>- What are the key factors and relationships?<br>- What are the analytical limitations?	FSA::Module_11::Concept
What is the difference between "computation" and "analysis" in financial statement analysis?	<b>Computation</b> is the act of calculating ratios and creating tables.<br><br><b>Analysis</b> is the interpretation of that data. It goes beyond "what" happened to explain "why" it happened, whether it created value, and what it implies for the future.	FSA::Module_11::Concept
What are the key contexts for evaluating a company's financial ratios?	1. <b>Prior Period Results:</b> Trend analysis to see if performance is improving or deteriorating.<br>2. <b>Expectations:</b> Comparing results to analyst or company forecasts.<br>3. <b>Industry Peers & Competitors:</b> Cross-sectional analysis to benchmark performance.<br>4. <b>Company Goals & Strategy:</b> Assessing if objectives are being met.<br>5. <b>Economic Conditions:</b> Understanding the macroeconomic environment.	FSA::Module_11::Concept
What are the limitations of financial ratio analysis?	- <b>Heterogeneity</b> of a company's operating divisions can make industry comparisons difficult.<br>- The need to determine if ratio results are <b>consistent</b> across different categories.<br>- The need for <b>judgment</b>, as ratios are indicators, not definitive answers.<br>- The use of <b>alternative accounting methods</b> can distort comparability.	FSA::Module_11::Concept
<center><b>--- Activity Ratios (Efficiency) ---</b></center>	<i>Activity ratios measure how efficiently a company manages its assets and operations.</i>	FSA::Module_11::Header
**What is the formula for Inventory Turnover?**	Measures how many times a company sells its average inventory over a period.<br><br>\[\text{Inventory Turnover} = \frac{\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\text{Average Inventory}}\]	FSA::Module_11::Formula
How is a high Inventory Turnover ratio interpreted?	A high turnover can indicate <b>high efficiency</b>. However, it could also indicate <b>inadequate inventory levels</b>, which might lead to lost sales (stock-outs).	FSA::Module_11::Concept
How is a low Inventory Turnover ratio interpreted?	A low turnover can indicate <b>inefficiency</b> or <b>obsolete inventory</b>. This suggests the company is holding onto inventory for too long, incurring high carrying costs.	FSA::Module_11::Concept
**What is the formula for Days of Inventory on Hand (DOH)?**	Measures the average number of days inventory is held before it is sold.<br><br>\[\text{Days of Inventory on Hand (DOH)} = \frac{365}{\text{Inventory Turnover}}\]	FSA::Module_11::Formula
**What is the formula for Receivables Turnover?**	Measures a company's efficiency in collecting its accounts receivable.<br><br>\[\text{Receivables Turnover} = \frac{\text{Revenue}}{\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}\]	FSA::Module_11::Formula
**What is the formula for Days of Sales Outstanding (DSO)?**	Measures the average number of days it takes for a company to collect payment after a sale.<br><br>\[\text{Days of Sales Outstanding (DSO)} = \frac{365}{\text{Receivables Turnover}}\]	FSA::Module_11::Formula
How is a high DSO interpreted?	A high DSO (or low receivables turnover) suggests inefficiency in collecting cash from customers. It may indicate that the company has loose credit policies or is having trouble with collections.	FSA::Module_11::Concept
What is the formula for Payables Turnover?	Measures how many times per period a company theoretically pays off its suppliers.<br><br>\[\text{Payables Turnover} = \frac{\text{Purchases}}{\text{Average Accounts Payable}}\]<br><i>Note: COGS is often used as a substitute for Purchases.</i>	FSA::Module_11::Formula
What is the formula for Number of Days of Payables?	Measures the average number of days a company takes to pay its suppliers.<br><br>\[\text{Number of Days of Payables} = \frac{365}{\text{Payables Turnover}}\]	FSA::Module_11::Formula
How is a high Number of Days of Payables interpreted?	A high number could indicate that the company is taking advantage of lenient supplier credit terms (good), or it could signal trouble making payments on time (bad).	FSA::Module_11::Concept
What is the formula for Working Capital Turnover?	Measures how efficiently a company uses its working capital to generate revenue.<br><br>\[\text{Working Capital Turnover} = \frac{\text{Revenue}}{\text{Average Working Capital}}\]	FSA::Module_11::Formula

**What is the formula for the Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)?**	A more stringent liquidity measure that excludes less-liquid assets like inventory.<br><br>\[\text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cash} + \text{Marketable Securities} + \text{Accounts Receivable}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}\]	FSA::Module_11::Formula
What is the formula for the Cash Ratio?	The most conservative liquidity measure, indicating the extent to which a company can pay its current liabilities with only cash and cash equivalents.<br><br>\[\text{Cash Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cash} + \text{Marketable Securities}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}\]	FSA::Module_11::Formula
What is the formula for the Defensive Interval Ratio?	Measures how long a company can pay its daily cash expenditures using only its existing liquid assets without any additional cash inflow.<br><br>\[\text{Defensive Interval Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cash} + \text{Marketable Securities} + \text{Receivables}}{\text{Daily Cash Expenditures}}\]	FSA::Module_11::Formula
**What is the formula for the Cash Conversion Cycle (Net Operating Cycle)?**	Measures the length of time in days it takes to convert invested cash into collected cash.<br><br>\[\text{Cash Conversion Cycle} = \text{DOH} + \text{DSO} - \text{Number of Days of Payables}\]	FSA::Module_11::Formula
<center><b>--- Solvency Ratios ---</b></center>	<i>Solvency ratios measure a company's ability to meet its long-term obligations.</i>	FSA::Module_11::Header
What are the two primary types of solvency ratios?	1. <b>Debt Ratios:</b> Focus on the balance sheet and measure the amount of debt capital relative to equity capital.<br>2. <b>Coverage Ratios:</b> Focus on the income statement and measure the ability of a company to cover its debt payments.	FSA::Module_11::Concept
**What is the formula for the Debt-to-Equity Ratio?**	Measures the amount of debt capital relative to equity capital.<br><br>\[\text{Debt-to-Equity Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Total Equity}}\]	FSA::Module_11::Formula

**What is the formula for the Financial Leverage Ratio?**	Measures the amount of total assets supported for each unit of equity. A higher ratio indicates greater use of leverage.<br><br>\[\text{Financial Leverage} = \frac{\text{Average Total Assets}}{\text{Average Total Equity}}\]	FSA::Module_11::Formula
**What is the formula for the Interest Coverage Ratio (Times Interest Earned)?**	Measures the number of times a company's EBIT can cover its interest payments.<br><br>\[\text{Interest Coverage} = \frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{Interest Payments}}\]	FSA::Module_11::Formula
<center><b>--- Profitability Ratios ---</b></center>	<i>Profitability ratios measure a company's ability to generate profits from its revenue and assets.</i>	FSA::Module_11::Header
What are the two main types of profitability ratios?	1. <b>Return on Sales:</b> Ratios that express various subtotals on the income statement as a percentage of revenue (e.g., profit margins).<br>2. <b>Return on Investment:</b> Ratios that measure income relative to assets, equity, or total capital.	FSA::Module_11::Concept
**What is the formula for Net Profit Margin?**	Measures the final percentage of revenue that is left after all expenses have been deducted.<br><br>\[\text{Net Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Revenue}}\]	FSA::Module_11::Formula
What is a common formula for Return on Assets (ROA)?	Measures the return earned by a company on its total assets.<br><br>\[\text{ROA} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Average Total Assets}}\]	FSA::Module_11::Formula
What is the issue with the common ROA formula and how can it be adjusted?	The issue is that Net Income (a return to equity holders) is compared to Total Assets (financed by both debt and equity).<br><br>An adjusted formula adds back the after-tax cost of debt to the numerator: \[\text{Adjusted ROA} = \frac{\text{Net Income} + \text{Interest Expense}(1 - \text{Tax rate})}{\text{Average Total Assets}}\]	FSA::Module_11::Concept
**What is the formula for Return on Equity (ROE)?**	Measures the rate of return earned by a company on its shareholders' equity. It is a key measure of overall company performance.<br><br>\[\text{ROE} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Average Shareholders' Equity}}\]	FSA::Module_11::Formula
What is the formula for Return on Common Equity (ROCE)?	Measures the rate of return earned on only the common equity, making it more specific than ROE when preferred stock exists.<br><br>\[\text{ROCE} = \frac{\text{Net Income} - \text{Preferred Dividends}}{\text{Average Common Equity}}\]	FSA::Module_11::Formula
<center><b>--- DuPont Analysis ---</b></center>	<i>A framework for decomposing ROE into its key drivers.</i>	FSA::Module_11::Header
What is the primary purpose of DuPont Analysis?	To decompose Return on Equity (ROE) into its component parts to understand the key drivers of a company's profitability. It helps identify whether ROE is driven by profitability, efficiency, or leverage.	FSA::Module_11::Concept
**What is the 3-Part DuPont Decomposition of ROE?**	Breaks down ROE into three core performance pillars: Net Profit Margin (profitability), Total Asset Turnover (efficiency), and Financial Leverage (solvency).<br><br>\[\text{ROE} = (\text{Net Profit Margin}) \times (\text{Asset Turnover}) \times (\text{Financial Leverage})\]<br>\[\text{ROE} = \left( \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Revenue}} \right) \times \left( \frac{\text{Revenue}}{\text{Avg Assets}} \right) \times \left( \frac{\text{Avg Assets}}{\text{Avg Equity}} \right)\]	FSA::Module_11::Formula
**What is the 5-Part DuPont Decomposition of ROE?**	Provides a more detailed breakdown by further decomposing the net profit margin to isolate the effects of taxes and interest.<br><br>\[\text{ROE} = (\text{Tax Burden}) \times (\text{Interest Burden}) \times (\text{EBIT Margin}) \times (\text{Asset Turnover}) \times (\text{Leverage})\]<br>\[\text{ROE} = \left( \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{EBT}} \right) \times \left( \frac{\text{EBT}}{\text{EBIT}} \right) \times \left( \frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{Revenue}} \right) \times \left( \frac{\text{Revenue}}{\text{Avg Assets}} \right) \times \left( \frac{\text{Avg Assets}}{\text{Avg Equity}} \right)\]	FSA::Module_11::Formula
How is the "Tax Burden" component of the 5-Part DuPont analysis interpreted?	It is calculated as (Net Income / EBT). It shows how much of the pre-tax profit is retained by the company. It is equal to (1 - Effective Tax Rate). A higher tax burden ratio means a lower tax rate, which is favorable for ROE.	FSA::Module_11::Concept
How is the "Interest Burden" component of the 5-Part DuPont analysis interpreted?	It is calculated as (EBT / EBIT). It shows how much of the operating profit (EBIT) remains after paying interest. A higher ratio indicates a lower interest burden, which is favorable for ROE.	FSA::Module_11::Concept
<center><b>--- Forecasting and Other Techniques ---</b></center>	<i>Using analysis to model and forecast future performance.</i>	FSA::Module_11::Header
How is ratio analysis used to model and forecast earnings?	Analysts use historical ratios and common-size statements, combined with forecasts for the economy and industry, to project future financial statements. For example, a stable DSO can be used to forecast future Accounts Receivable based on a revenue forecast.	FSA::Module_11::Concept
What is the difference between sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis?	<b>Sensitivity Analysis ("what-if"):</b> Shows the range of possible outcomes by changing one key assumption at a time (e.g., what is the effect on net income if the gross margin increases by 1%?).<br><br><b>Scenario Analysis:</b> Shows the changes in key financial metrics that result from a specific economic event or scenario (e.g., a recession scenario with lower sales and tighter margins).
