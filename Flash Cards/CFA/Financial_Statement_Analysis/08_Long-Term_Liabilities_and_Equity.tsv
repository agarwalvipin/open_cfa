For a contract to be classified as a lease, what three criteria must it meet?	1. There must be an <b>identified asset</b>.<br>2. The lessee must have the right to obtain substantially all of the <b>economic benefits</b> from use of the asset.<br>3. The lessee must have the right to <b>direct the use</b> of the asset.	FSA::Module_08::Concept
For a lessee, what is the initial accounting treatment for a lease (both finance and operating) under IFRS?	At lease inception, the lessee recognizes a <b>Right-of-Use (ROU) asset</b> and a <b>Lease Liability</b> on the balance sheet. Both are initially measured at the present value of future lease payments.	FSA::Module_08::Rule
Under IFRS, how does a lessee account for a lease after inception?	- The <b>Lease Liability</b> is amortized using the effective interest method. Each payment consists of interest expense and principal repayment.<br>- The <b>ROU Asset</b> is typically depreciated on a straight-line basis.<br>- On the cash flow statement, the principal portion of the payment is a financing outflow (CFF), and the interest portion is either an operating (CFO) or financing (CFF) outflow.	FSA::Module_08::Concept
What is the key difference in lessee accounting for an operating lease versus a finance lease under US GAAP?	<b>Finance Lease:</b> Same as IFRS (interest expense and amortization expense are recognized separately).<br><b>Operating Lease:</b> A single "lease expense" is recognized on the income statement, typically on a straight-line basis. The entire lease payment is classified as a cash outflow from operations (CFO).	FSA::Module_08::Comparison
For a lessor, what is the key accounting difference between a finance lease and an operating lease?	<b>Finance Lease:</b> The lessor de-recognizes the leased asset and recognizes a <b>lease receivable</b>. They earn interest income on the receivable over the lease term.<br><b>Operating Lease:</b> The lessor keeps the asset on its balance sheet, depreciates it, and recognizes lease revenue, typically on a straight-line basis.

What is the difference between a defined contribution pension plan and a defined benefit pension plan?	<b>Defined Contribution Plan:</b> The company's contribution is defined (e.g., a % of salary). The employee bears the investment risk, and the final benefit depends on the plan's performance.<br><b>Defined Benefit Plan:</b> The employee's ultimate benefit is defined by a formula (e.g., based on years of service and final salary). The company bears the investment and actuarial risk.	FSA::Module_08::Comparison
How is the funded status of a defined benefit pension plan calculated and reported?	Funded Status = Fair Value of Plan Assets - Present Value of Defined Benefit Obligation (PVDBO)<br>- If positive, a <b>net pension asset</b> is reported on the balance sheet.<br>- If negative, a <b>net pension liability</b> is reported.	FSA::Module_08::Formula
Under IFRS, what are the three components of the change in a company's net pension asset or liability?	1. <b>Service Costs:</b> Recognized in Profit & Loss (P&L).<br>2. <b>Net Interest Expense/Income:</b> Calculated on the beginning net pension asset/liability and recognized in P&L.<br>3. <b>Remeasurements:</b> Includes actuarial gains/losses and the difference between actual and expected return on plan assets. Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI).	FSA::Module_08::Concept
How is compensation expense for share-based compensation (e.g., stock options, restricted stock units) generally measured and recognized?	Compensation expense is measured at the <b>fair value of the award at the grant date</b>. This total expense is then recognized, typically on a straight-line basis, over the vesting period (the period during which the employee provides service to earn the award).	FSA::Module_08::Concept
What are stock appreciation rights (SARs)?	A form of cash-settled share-based compensation where an employee's bonus is based on the increase in the company's stock price over a specified period. No shares are actually issued, so there is no dilution for existing shareholders.	FSA::Module_08::Definition
