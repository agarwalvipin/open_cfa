What are the two primary measurement models for Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E) under IFRS?	1. <b>Cost Model:</b> The asset is carried at its cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.<br>2. <b>Revaluation Model:</b> The asset is carried at a revalued amount, which is its fair value at the date of revaluation, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Revaluations must be made with sufficient regularity.	FSA::Module_07::Rule
How is Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E) measured under US GAAP?	US GAAP only permits the <b>Cost Model</b>. The revaluation model is not allowed.	FSA::Module_07::Rule
How are intangible assets acquired in a business combination treated?	They are recognized as assets on the balance sheet at their fair value at the acquisition date, separate from goodwill.	FSA::Module_07::Concept
How is an impairment loss for PP&E measured under IFRS?	An impairment loss is recognized if the asset's <b>carrying amount</b> is greater than its <b>recoverable amount</b>. The loss is the difference between the two.<br><br>The recoverable amount is the higher of:<br>1. Fair value less costs to sell<br>2. Value in use (the present value of future cash flows from the asset).	FSA::Module_07::Concept
How is an impairment loss for PP&E recognized under US GAAP?	It is a two-step process:<br>1. <b>Recoverability Test:</b> An asset is considered impaired if its <b>carrying amount</b> is greater than the <b>undiscounted</b> future cash flows it is expected to generate.<br>2. <b>Loss Measurement:</b> If impaired, the loss is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the asset's <b>fair value</b>.	FSA::Module_07::Concept
Can impairment losses on long-lived assets held for use be reversed?	<b>Under IFRS:</b> Yes, impairment losses can be reversed if the asset's recoverable amount increases. The reversal is limited to the asset's carrying amount had no impairment been recognized.<br><br><b>Under US GAAP:</b> No, reversals of impairment losses are prohibited for assets held for use.	FSA::Module_07::Comparison
How is a long-lived asset classified as "held for sale" accounted for?	Once an asset is classified as held for sale, depreciation ceases. It is measured at the lower of its carrying amount and its fair value less costs to sell.	FSA::Module_07::Concept
How is the gain or loss on the sale of a long-lived asset calculated?	\[\text{Gain or Loss} = \text{Sales Proceeds} - \text{Carrying Amount at time of sale}\]<br>The carrying amount is typically its original cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.	FSA::Module_07::Formula
What does the Fixed Asset Turnover ratio measure?	It measures the efficiency with which a company uses its fixed assets to generate revenue.<br><br>\[\text{Fixed Asset Turnover} = \frac{\text{Revenue}}{\text{Average Net Fixed Assets}}\]	FSA::Module_07::Formula
How can you estimate the average age of a company's depreciable assets?	By using the relationship between accumulated depreciation and depreciation expense.<br><br>\[\text{Average Age} = \frac{\text{Accumulated Depreciation}}{\text{Depreciation Expense}}\]	FSA::Module_07::Formula
How can you estimate the average remaining useful life of a company's depreciable assets?	By using the relationship between net PP&E and depreciation expense.<br><br>\[\text{Average Remaining Life} = \frac{\text{Net PP\&E}}{\text{Depreciation Expense}}\]	FSA::Module_07::Formula
What are some of the key financial statement disclosures for PP&E?	- Measurement bases used (e.g., cost or revaluation model).<br>- Depreciation methods used.<br>- Useful lives or depreciation rates used.<br>- Gross carrying amount and accumulated depreciation at the beginning and end of the period.<br>- A reconciliation of the carrying amount from the beginning to the end of the period (showing additions, disposals, impairments, etc.).
