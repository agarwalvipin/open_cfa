What are the three main classifications for financial assets (investments in debt and equity)?	1. <b>Measured at Amortized Cost</b> (e.g., Held-to-maturity debt)<br>2. <b>Measured at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI)</b> (e.g., Available-for-sale debt)<br>3. <b>Measured at Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVPL)</b> (e.g., Trading securities)	FSA::Module_03::Concept

A more conservative liquidity ratio than the current ratio.<br>\[\text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cash} + \text{Marketable Securities} + \text{Accounts Receivable}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}\]<br>It excludes less liquid assets like inventory.
