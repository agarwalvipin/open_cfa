What is the core principle of revenue recognition under converged IFRS and US GAAP standards?	Revenue should be recognized to "depict the <b>transfer of promised goods or services</b> to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in an exchange for those goods or services."	FSA::Module_02::Definition
What are the five steps for revenue recognition under the converged standards?	1. Identify the <b>contract(s)</b> with a customer.<br>2. Identify the separate or distinct <b>performance obligations</b> in the contract.<br>3. Determine the <b>transaction price</b>.<br>4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations.<br>5. Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity <b>satisfies a performance obligation</b>.	FSA::Module_02::Concept
How do IFRS and US GAAP differ regarding the criterion for probable collectability in revenue recognition?	Under IFRS, "probable" means <b>more likely than not</b>.<br><br>Under US GAAP, "probable" means <b>likely to occur</b>. This difference means economically similar contracts may be treated differently under the two standards.	FSA::Module_02::Comparison
How do companies recognize revenue when acting as a Principal versus an Agent?	<b>Principal:</b> Controls the product/service before transfer to the customer, recognizing revenue as the <b>total amount of consideration received</b> (gross basis).<br><b>Agent:</b> Arranges for the transfer, recognizing revenue only for the <b>fee or commission</b> received (net basis).	FSA::Module_02::Concept
What is the "matching principle" of expense recognition?	Expenses should be recognized in the same period as the associated revenues they helped generate.	FSA::Module_02::Definition
What is the difference between capitalizing and expensing a cost?	<b>Capitalizing:</b> Recording a cost as an <b>asset</b> on the balance sheet, which is then expensed over the asset's useful life (e.g., depreciation or amortization).<br><b>Expensing:</b> Recording a cost as an <b>expense</b> on the income statement in the period incurred.	FSA::Module_02::Comparison
How does capitalization affect a company's financial statements compared to expensing in the first year?	Capitalization results in <b>higher Net Income</b> and <b>higher Cash Flow from Operations</b> (as the expense is classified as an Investing cash outflow). Total assets are also higher.	FSA::Module_02::Concept
How are unusual or infrequent items treated in financial statements under IFRS and US GAAP?	They are generally shown as part of the company's <b>continuing operations</b> but disclosed separately on the income statement or in the notes.<br><br>Examples include restructuring charges or gains/losses from asset sales.	FSA::Module_02::Concept
How are discontinued operations reported under IFRS and US GAAP?	The results of discontinued operations are reported separately, on a <b>net basis</b>, at the bottom of the income statement, below continuing operations.	FSA::Module_02::Concept
What is the definition of Basic Earnings Per Share (Basic EPS)?	Basic EPS is the amount of income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding over a period.	FSA::Module_02::Definition
What is the formula for Basic Earnings Per Share (Basic EPS)?	\[\text{Basic EPS} = \frac{\text{Net income} - \text{Preferred dividends}}{\text{Weighted average number of common shares outstanding}}\]	FSA::Module_02::Formula
When does a company have a "complex capital structure"?	When it has issued financial instruments that are potentially convertible into common stock (e.g., convertible bonds, convertible preferred stock, employee stock options, warrants).	FSA::Module_02::Concept
What is the definition of Diluted Earnings Per Share (Diluted EPS)?	Diluted EPS reflects what a company's EPS would have been if all potentially dilutive financial instruments outstanding had been converted into common stock.	FSA::Module_02::Definition
What is the relationship between Basic EPS and Diluted EPS?	Diluted EPS is always <b>less than or equal to</b> Basic EPS.	FSA::Module_02::Concept
What are "antidilutive" securities?	Securities that would result in a Diluted EPS higher than the Basic EPS if converted. They are **not** included in the calculation of Diluted EPS.	FSA::Module_02::Definition
What is the "If-Converted Method" used for?	Calculating Diluted EPS assuming the conversion of convertible bonds or convertible preferred stock into common shares.	FSA::Module_02::Concept
What is the "Treasury Stock Method" used for?	Calculating Diluted EPS for employee stock options, warrants, and their equivalents. It assumes that proceeds from the exercise are used to repurchase as many shares as possible at the average market price.	FSA::Module_02::Concept
What is a Common-Size Income Statement?	An income statement where each line item is expressed as a <b>percentage of revenue</b> (or sales).	FSA::Module_02::Concept
How are Common-Size Income Statements useful in financial analysis?	They facilitate time-series (comparing a company to itself over time) and cross-sectional (comparing a company to peers of different sizes) analysis by removing the effect of size.	FSA::Module_02::Concept
What is the formula for Net Profit Margin?	\[\text{Net Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Revenue}}\]	FSA::Module_02::Formula
What is the formula for Gross Profit Margin?	\[\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Revenue}}\]	FSA::Module_02::Formula
