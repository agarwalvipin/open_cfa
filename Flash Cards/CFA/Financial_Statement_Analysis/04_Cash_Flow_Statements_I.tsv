Compare the Direct and Indirect methods for presenting Cash Flow from Operating Activities (CFO).	The <b>Direct Method</b> shows the major classes of gross cash receipts and gross cash payments (e.g., cash received from customers, cash paid to suppliers).<br><br>The <b>Indirect Method</b> starts with net income and reconciles it to net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting for non-cash items and changes in working capital accounts. Both methods result in the same net CFO amount.	FSA::Module_04::Comparison
