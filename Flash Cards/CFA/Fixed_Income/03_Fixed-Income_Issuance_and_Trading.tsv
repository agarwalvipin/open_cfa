What is a key difference between equity indexes and fixed-income indexes regarding the number of constituents?	Fixed-income indexes typically have far more constituent securities than equity indexes because a single issuer may have many different bonds outstanding at any given time.	Fixed_Income::Module_03::Comparison
Why do bond indexes exhibit higher turnover than equity indexes?	Bond indexes have higher turnover due to two main factors:<br>1. <b>Finite maturity:</b> Bonds mature and must be removed from the index.<br>2. <b>Higher frequency of new issuance:</b> Companies and governments issue new debt more frequently than new equity.	Fixed_Income::Module_03::Concept
How are constituents in a bond index typically weighted?	Bond index constituents are usually weighted by the <b>market value of their debt outstanding</b>, which is analogous to the market-capitalization weighting used in equity indexes.	Fixed_Income::Module_03::Concept

An offering where a financial intermediary acts only as a broker, trying to sell the bond issue at the negotiated price on a commission basis without guaranteeing the sale. This is more common for bonds of lower credit quality.	Fixed_Income::Module_03::Definition
What is a <b>shelf registration</b>?	A filing that allows frequent bond issuers to create a broad, all-encompassing offering circular that can be updated regularly and used for a range of future bond issuances, allowing them to issue bonds opportunistically when market conditions are favorable.	Fixed_Income::Module_03::Definition
How are sovereign bonds typically issued in the primary market?	Primary market issuance of sovereign debt usually takes the form of a <b>public auction</b> led by the national treasury or finance ministry.	Fixed_Income::Module_03::Concept
