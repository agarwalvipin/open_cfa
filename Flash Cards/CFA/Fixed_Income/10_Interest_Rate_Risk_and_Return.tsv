What are the three sources of return from investing in a fixed-rate bond?	1. Receipt of the promised coupon and principal payments.<br>2. Reinvestment of coupon payments.<br>3. A capital gain or loss on the sale of the bond if it is sold prior to maturity.	Fixed_Income::Module_10::Concept
What is the "interest-on-interest" component of a bond's return?	It is the gain from reinvesting a bond's coupon payments. The total return is composed of the total coupons paid plus the interest-on-interest.	Fixed_Income::Module_10::Definition
What is the <b>horizon yield</b> of a bond investment?	The <b>horizon yield</b> is the investor's total return (including reinvested coupons and the sale/redemption price) expressed as an annualized internal rate of return (IRR) over the investment horizon.	Fixed_Income::Module_10::Definition
Under what three assumptions will an investor's <b>horizon yield</b> equal the bond's <b>yield-to-maturity (YTM)</b> at the time of purchase?	1. The investor holds the bond to maturity.<br>2. The issuer does not default on any payments.<br>3. The investor reinvests all coupon payments at the original YTM.	Fixed_Income::Module_10::Concept
What is the <b>carrying value</b> of a bond?	The carrying value at a point in time is the purchase price plus the amortized amount of any discount (if bought below par) or minus the amortized amount of any premium (if bought above par). It represents the bond's value on its constant-yield price trajectory.	Fixed_Income::Module_10::Definition
What are the two offsetting types of interest rate risk for a bond investor?	1. <b>Reinvestment Risk:</b> The risk that future coupon payments will have to be reinvested at lower interest rates, reducing the future value of the investment. This risk dominates for long-horizon investors.<br>2. <b>Price Risk:</b> The risk that the price of the bond will fall if interest rates rise. This risk dominates for short-horizon investors.	Fixed_Income::Module_10::Comparison
What is <b>Macaulay Duration</b> conceptually?	<b>Macaulay Duration</b> is the investment horizon at which the two components of interest rate risk—reinvestment risk and price risk—are perfectly offsetting for a one-time, parallel shift in the yield curve. An investor holding a bond for its Macaulay duration is nearly hedged against interest rate risk.	Fixed_Income::Module_10::Concept
What is the formal definition of <b>Macaulay Duration</b>?	It is the <b>weighted-average time to receipt</b> of a bond's cash flows, where the weights are the present value of each cash flow expressed as a percentage of the bond's full price.	Fixed_Income::Module_10::Definition
How does Macaulay Duration relate to a bond's time-to-maturity?	For a coupon-paying bond, the Macaulay duration is <b>less than</b> its time-to-maturity.<br><br>For a <b>zero-coupon bond</b>, the Macaulay duration is <b>equal to</b> its time-to-maturity.	Fixed_Income::Module_10::Comparison
What is the <b>Duration Gap</b> and how is it calculated?	The duration gap measures the mismatch between an investor's horizon and the bond's Macaulay duration. It indicates the investor's primary risk exposure.<br>\[ \text{Duration Gap} = \text{Macaulay Duration} - \text{Investment Horizon} \]	Fixed_Income::Module_10::Formula
What is the implication of a <b>positive duration gap</b>?	A positive duration gap (Macaulay Duration > Investment Horizon) means the investor has a shorter horizon. <b>Price risk</b> is the dominant risk, and the investor is primarily concerned about <b>rising interest rates</b>.	Fixed_Income::Module_10::Concept
What is the implication of a <b>negative duration gap</b>?	A negative duration gap (Macaulay Duration < Investment Horizon) means the investor has a longer horizon. <b>Reinvestment risk</b> is the dominant risk, and the investor is primarily concerned about <b>falling interest rates</b>.	Fixed_Income::Module_10::Concept
How does Macaulay Duration change as time passes?	Macaulay duration is not static; it decreases as time passes and the bond approaches maturity. However, it does not decrease one-for-one with the passage of time.	Fixed_Income::Module_10::Concept
