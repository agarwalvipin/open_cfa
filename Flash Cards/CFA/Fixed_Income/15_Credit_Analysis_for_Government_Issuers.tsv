What is the principle of <b>sovereign immunity</b> and why is it critical in sovereign credit analysis?	Sovereign immunity is a legal principle that limits the ability of creditors to force a sovereign government into bankruptcy or liquidate its assets to settle debt claims. This makes the sovereign's <b>willingness to pay</b> as important as its <b>ability to pay</b>.	Fixed_Income::Module_15::Concept
What are the five main qualitative factors in sovereign credit analysis?	1. <b>Government Institutions & Policy:</b> The stability and predictability of political institutions and policies.<br>2. <b>Fiscal Flexibility:</b> The ability to adjust government spending and taxation to maintain fiscal discipline.<br>3. <b>Monetary Effectiveness:</b> The credibility and independence of the central bank.<br>4. <b>Economic Flexibility:</b> The size, diversification, and growth potential of the economy.<br>5. <b>External Status:</b> The status of the currency (e.g., reserve currency) and access to external funding.

What is a <b>reserve currency</b> and why is it important for sovereign creditworthiness?	A reserve currency is a currency that is fully convertible and held in significant quantities by foreign central banks and investors. Having a reserve currency greatly expands a government's ability to finance its debt and sustain deficits, enhancing its creditworthiness.	Fixed_Income::Module_15::Definition
What are the two main categories of quantitative ratios used to assess a sovereign's <b>Fiscal Strength</b>?	1. <b>Debt Burden ratios:</b> Similar to leverage, these measure solvency (e.g., Debt-to-GDP, Debt-to-Revenue).<br>2. <b>Debt Affordability ratios:</b> Similar to coverage, these measure the ability to service debt (e.g., Interest-to-GDP, Interest-to-Revenue).

What quantitative factors are used to assess a sovereign's <b>Economic Growth and Stability</b>?	Key factors include the size of the economy (GDP), per capita income, real GDP growth rate, and the volatility (standard deviation) of that growth.	Fixed_Income::Module_15::Concept
What quantitative factors are used to assess a sovereign's <b>External Stability</b>?	Key factors include the size of foreign currency reserves, the external debt burden (long-term external debt to GDP), and near-term external debt requirements.	Fixed_Income::Module_15::Concept
What are <b>Agencies</b> or <b>Quasi-Government Entities</b>?	These are entities created to fulfill a specific government-sponsored mission, such as operating an airport or supporting housing finance. They are not the sovereign government itself but typically have a high likelihood of government support, resulting in a high credit rating.	Fixed_Income::Module_15::Definition
What are <b>Supranational Issuers</b>?	Organizations like the World Bank or IMF that are created and owned by multiple sovereign governments to pursue a common objective. Due to the backing of their member states, they typically have the highest credit quality.	Fixed_Income::Module_15::Definition
What is the primary difference between a <b>General Obligation (GO) Bond</b> and a <b>Revenue Bond</b>?	A <b>GO Bond</b> is an unsecured bond backed by the full taxing power of a non-sovereign government (e.g., a state or province).<br><br>A <b>Revenue Bond</b> is issued to finance a specific project and is repaid solely from the revenues generated by that project (e.g., tolls from a bridge).

What is the key credit metric for analyzing a <b>Revenue Bond</b>?	The <b>debt service coverage ratio (DSCR)</b>, which measures the amount of revenue generated by the specific project available to cover principal and interest payments after operating expenses. A higher ratio indicates stronger creditworthiness.	Fixed_Income::Module_15::Concept
