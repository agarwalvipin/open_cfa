What is <b>Prepayment Risk</b>?	The risk that the principal of a loan is repaid at a different pace than the original schedule. It has two components: contraction risk and extension risk.	Fixed_Income::Module_19::Definition
What is <b>Contraction Risk</b>?	The risk that a borrower will repay the loan principal more quickly than anticipated. This typically occurs when interest rates fall, leading homeowners to refinance. The investor receives their principal back sooner but must reinvest at lower rates.	Fixed_Income::Module_19::Concept
What is <b>Extension Risk</b>?	The risk that a borrower will repay the loan principal more slowly than anticipated. This typically occurs when interest rates rise, as homeowners are less likely to refinance or move. The investor is stuck receiving lower coupon payments for a longer period.	Fixed_Income::Module_19::Concept
What is <b>Time Tranching</b>?	A structure used in securitizations to redistribute prepayment risk by creating bond classes (tranches) with different expected maturities.	Fixed_Income::Module_19::Definition
What is a <b>mortgage loan</b>?	A loan secured by the collateral of a specified real estate property. The lender has a <b>first lien</b> on the property, giving them the right to seize it (<b>foreclosure</b>) if the borrower defaults.	Fixed_income::Module_19::Definition
What is the <b>Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio</b>?	The ratio of the mortgage loan amount to the market value of the property. A lower LTV implies higher borrower equity and lower risk for the lender.	Fixed_income::Module_19::Definition
What is the <b>Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio</b>?	A ratio used for residential lending that compares an individual's total monthly debt payments to their monthly pre-tax (gross) income. Lenders use it to assess a borrower's capacity to sustain debt payments.	Fixed_income::Module_19::Definition
Distinguish between <b>prime</b> and <b>subprime</b> mortgage loans.	<b>Prime loans</b> are made to borrowers with high credit quality, strong employment histories, and low DTI ratios.<br><br><b>Subprime loans</b> are made to borrowers with lower credit quality, high DTI ratios, and/or higher LTV ratios.	Fixed_income::Module_19::Comparison
What is the difference between <b>Agency RMBS</b> and <b>Non-Agency RMBS</b> in the US?	<b>Agency RMBS</b> are guaranteed by a federal agency (like Ginnie Mae) or a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE, like Fannie Mae).<br><br><b>Non-Agency RMBS</b> are issued by private entities and do not carry any government guarantee; they rely on credit enhancements to mitigate credit risk.	Fixed_income::Module_19::Comparison
What is a <b>mortgage pass-through security</b>?	A security created by pooling mortgages and "passing through" the principal and interest payments from the pool to the security holders on a pro-rata basis.	Fixed_income::Module_19::Definition
What are the <b>Weighted Average Coupon (WAC)</b> and <b>Weighted Average Maturity (WAM)</b> of a mortgage pool?	<b>WAC:</b> The weighted average of the interest rates on the mortgages in the pool, weighted by the outstanding principal balance of each mortgage.<br><br><b>WAM:</b> The weighted average of the remaining months to maturity of the mortgages in the pool, weighted by the outstanding principal balance.	Fixed_income::Module_19::Definition
What are <b>Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs)</b>?	Securities that are collateralized by a pool of mortgage pass-through securities or mortgage loans. They use tranching to redistribute cash flows and risks (especially prepayment risk) to different bond classes to meet various investor needs.	Fixed_income::Module_19::Definition
What is a <b>sequential-pay CMO</b>?	A CMO structure where principal payments are directed to the tranches in a specific sequence. Principal is paid to the first tranche (Tranche A) until its balance is zero, then to the second tranche (Tranche B), and so on. This is a form of time tranching.	Fixed_income::Module_19::Definition
What is a <b>Z-Tranche</b> in a CMO?	A tranche that does not receive interest payments until a pre-set date; instead, the interest accrues, increasing the principal balance. The cash flow that would have gone to the Z-tranche is used to pay other tranches. It is also known as an accrual bond.	Fixed_income::Module_19::Definition
What are <b>Principal-Only (PO)</b> and <b>Interest-Only (IO)</b> securities?	<b>PO securities</b> receive only the principal payments from the underlying mortgage pool. Their value increases as prepayments accelerate.<br><br><b>IO securities</b> receive only the interest payments from the underlying pool. Their value decreases as prepayments accelerate because the principal balance generating the interest declines faster.	Fixed_income::Module_19::Comparison
What are <b>Planned Amortization Class (PAC) tranches</b> in a CMO?	PAC tranches offer the most predictable cash flows and protection from prepayment risk. They are designed to make fixed, scheduled principal payments as long as the prepayment rate on the underlying collateral stays within a specified range (the "PAC collar").	Fixed_income::Module_19::Definition
What is a <b>support tranche</b> (or companion tranche) in a CMO?	A tranche that absorbs prepayment risk to protect a PAC tranche. If prepayment rates are faster than expected, the support tranche receives the excess principal. If prepayment rates are slower, the PAC tranche has priority for principal payments over the support tranche.	Fixed_income::Module_19::Definition
What is <b>call protection</b> in the context of CMBS?	Features that protect investors from prepayment risk. This is a key distinction from RMBS. It can be achieved at the structural level (e.g., sequential-pay tranches) or at the individual loan level.	Fixed_income::Module_19::Concept
What are three loan-level call protection mechanisms in CMBS?	1. <b>Prepayment Lockout:</b> A period where any prepayment is contractually prohibited.<br>2. <b>Prepayment Penalty Points:</b> Predetermined fees a borrower must pay if they refinance.<br>3. <b>Defeasance:</b> The borrower must purchase a portfolio of government securities that replicate the loan's cash flows to prepay the loan.	Fixed_income::Module_19::Concept
What is <b>balloon risk</b> in CMBS?	The risk that a borrower fails to make the large final "balloon" payment at the maturity of a commercial loan. This is a form of extension risk, as the lender may be forced to extend the loan term.	Fixed_income::Module_19::Definition
What is the <b>Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)</b> in CMBS analysis?	A key credit metric for commercial real estate loans, calculated as the property's annual Net Operating Income (NOI) divided by its annual debt service. A ratio greater than 1.0x indicates sufficient cash flow to cover debt payments.<br><br>\[ DSCR = \frac{\text{Net Operating Income}}{\text{Debt Service}} \]	Fixed_income::Module_19::Formula
