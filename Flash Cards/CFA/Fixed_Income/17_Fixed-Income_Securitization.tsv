What is <b>securitization</b>?	The process of pooling and transferring the ownership of cash flow-generating assets (like loans or receivables) from an original lender into a specially created legal entity (an SPE), which then issues securities backed by these pooled assets to investors.

What is the primary benefit of securitization for <b>issuers</b> (originators)?	Issuers can operate more efficiently on a risk-adjusted basis by <b>removing assets and lending risks from their balance sheets</b>. This reduces leverage, lowers funding costs, generates fee income, and expands their capacity to originate new loans.	Fixed_Income::Module_17::Concept
What are two key benefits of securitization for <b>investors</b>?	1. It allows investors to <b>tailor interest rate and credit risk exposures</b> to suit their specific needs.<br>2. It provides access to a wider range of underlying assets (e.g., auto loans, credit card receivables), allowing for greater portfolio diversification.	Fixed_Income::Module_17::Concept
How does securitization benefit <b>financial markets and economies</b>?	It enhances financial market efficiency by creating <b>tradable securities with higher liquidity</b> than the original underlying assets. It also provides an alternative means of funding for business operations beyond traditional financing.	Fixed_Income::Module_17::Concept
What are the three main parties in a securitization transaction?	1. The <b>seller</b> of the collateral (also called the depositor or originator).<br>2. The <b>Special Purpose Entity (SPE)</b> that purchases the assets and issues the ABS.<br>3. The <b>servicer</b> of the underlying loans.	Fixed_Income::Module_17::Concept
What is a <b>Special Purpose Entity (SPE)</b> and what is its primary role?	An SPE is a separate legal entity created specifically for a securitization. Its role is to purchase the collateral from the originator and issue securities (ABS) to investors. It is structured to be <b>bankruptcy-remote</b> from the seller.	Fixed_Income::Module_17::Definition
What does it mean for an SPE to be <b>"bankruptcy-remote"</b>?	It means that the SPE is a legally separate entity from the seller of the assets. If the seller files for bankruptcy, the assets held by the SPE are protected and are not available to the seller's creditors. This is a critical feature that decouples the credit risk of the ABS from the credit risk of the originator.	Fixed_Income::Module_17::Concept
What is the role of the <b>servicer</b> in a securitization?	The servicer is responsible for administering the underlying loans, which includes collecting payments from borrowers, notifying delinquent borrowers, and recovering and disposing of assets if a borrower defaults.	Fixed_Income::Module_17::Concept
What is the difference between a <b>covered bond</b> and a <b>pass-through security</b>?	<b>Covered Bonds:</b> The underlying assets remain on the issuer's balance sheet. Investors have dual recourse to both the segregated asset pool and the issuer.<br><br><b>Pass-Through Securities:</b> This is a "true securitization" where the assets are removed from the issuer's balance sheet and transferred to a separate SPE.

What is a <b>mortgage-backed security (MBS)</b>?	An asset-backed security (ABS) that is collateralized by a pool of mortgages.	Fixed_Income::Module_17::Definition
What is a <b>purchase agreement</b> in a securitization?	The legal document between the seller of the collateral and the SPE. It outlines the representations and warranties the seller makes about the quality of the assets being sold, which is a key consideration for investors.	Fixed_Income::Module_17::Definition
What is a <b>prospectus</b> in a securitization?	The legal document that describes the structure of the securitization. It details the priority of payments (the waterfall), credit enhancements, and the roles and rights of all parties involved.	Fixed_Income::Module_17::Definition
