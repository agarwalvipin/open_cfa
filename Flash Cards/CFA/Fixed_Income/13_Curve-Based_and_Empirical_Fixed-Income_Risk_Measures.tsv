Why are yield duration and convexity less useful for bonds with embedded options (e.g., callable bonds)?	Yield duration and convexity assume a bond's cash flows are certain. For bonds with embedded options, future cash flows are <b>uncertain</b> because the option's exercise depends on future interest rates, which can alter the timing and amount of payments.

What is <b>Effective Duration</b>?	A <b>curve duration</b> measure that estimates the sensitivity of a bond's price to a parallel shift in a benchmark yield curve (e.g., the government par curve). It is the most appropriate measure for bonds with uncertain cash flows, such as those with embedded options.	Fixed_Income::Module_13::Definition
What is the formula for calculating <b>Effective Duration (EffDur)</b>?	Effective duration is calculated by repricing the bond for a small parallel shift up and down in the benchmark yield curve.<br>\[EffDur \approx \frac{(PV_-) - (PV_+)}{2 \times (\Delta \text{Curve}) \times (PV_0)}\]<br>Where <b>Î”Curve</b> is the change in the benchmark yield curve in decimal form.	Fixed_Income::Module_13::Formula
What is <b>Effective Convexity (EffCon)</b>?	A <b>curve convexity</b> measure that quantifies the second-order (non-linear) price sensitivity of a bond to a parallel shift in a benchmark yield curve. It is used for bonds with uncertain cash flows.	Fixed_Income::Module_13::Definition
What is the formula for calculating <b>Effective Convexity (EffCon)</b>?	Effective convexity is calculated by repricing the bond for a small parallel shift up and down in the benchmark yield curve.<br>\[EffCon \approx \frac{[(PV_-) + (PV_+)] - [2 \times (PV_0)]}{(\Delta \text{Curve})^2 \times (PV_0)}\]	Fixed_Income::Module_13::Formula
How is the percentage price change of a bond estimated using Effective Duration and Effective Convexity?	The percentage price change is estimated by combining the effects of effective duration and convexity for a given parallel shift in the benchmark curve.<br>\[ \% \Delta PV_{Full} \approx (-\text{EffDur} \times \Delta \text{Curve}) + \left[\frac{1}{2} \times \text{EffCon} \times (\Delta \text{Curve})^2\right] \]	Fixed_Income::Module_13::Formula
How does an embedded <b>call option</b> affect a bond's effective duration and convexity?	As benchmark yields fall, the call option becomes more valuable to the issuer, limiting the bond's price appreciation. This causes the bond's <b>effective duration to decrease</b> and its <b>effective convexity to become negative</b> at low yield levels.	Fixed_Income::Module_13::Concept
What is <b>negative convexity</b>?	An attribute of a callable bond where the bond's price appreciation from a yield decrease is less than its price depreciation from a yield increase of the same magnitude. The price-yield curve becomes concave at low yields.	Fixed_Income::Module_13::Definition
How does an embedded <b>put option</b> affect a bond's effective duration?	As benchmark yields rise, the put option becomes more valuable to the investor, limiting the bond's price depreciation (as the investor can sell the bond back at the put price). This causes the bond's <b>effective duration to decrease</b> as rates rise.	Fixed_Income::Module_13::Concept
What is <b>Key Rate Duration</b>?	A measure of a bond's price sensitivity to a change in the benchmark yield at a <b>specific maturity</b> on the yield curve. It is used to assess a bond's sensitivity to non-parallel shifts in the yield curve (shaping risk). It is also known as partial duration.	Fixed_Income::Module_13::Definition
What is <b>shaping risk</b> in the context of fixed-income?	Shaping risk is the risk that the shape of the yield curve changes (e.g., steepens, flattens, or twists), causing changes in bond prices that are not captured by measures that assume parallel shifts, like effective duration.	Fixed_Income::Module_13::Definition
What is the relationship between a bond's Key Rate Durations and its Effective Duration?	The <b>sum</b> of a bond's key rate durations across all specified maturities on the benchmark yield curve is equal to the bond's effective duration.<br>\[ \sum_{k=1}^{n} \text{KeyRateDur}_k = \text{EffDur} \]	Fixed_Income::Module_13::Formula
How is a bond's price change estimated using a specific Key Rate Duration?	The percentage price change is estimated by multiplying the negative of the specific key rate duration by the change in the key rate at that maturity.<br>\[ \frac{\Delta PV}{PV} = -\text{KeyRateDur}_k \times \Delta r_k \]	Fixed_Income::Module_13::Formula
What is the difference between <b>analytical duration</b> and <b>empirical duration</b>?	<b>Analytical duration</b> (e.g., modified, effective) is estimated using mathematical formulas based on a bond's features and assumes that benchmark yields and credit spreads are uncorrelated.<br><br><b>Empirical duration</b> is estimated using historical data in statistical models, which can incorporate the actual observed correlation between benchmark yields and credit spreads.	Fixed_Income::Module_13::Comparison
Why might empirical duration be a more accurate measure than analytical duration for a corporate bond during a "flight to quality"?	During a "flight to quality," benchmark yields fall while credit spreads widen (a negative correlation). <b>Analytical duration</b> would only capture the price increase from falling benchmark yields. <b>Empirical duration</b> would capture both effects, showing that the widening credit spread offsets some or all of the price gain, resulting in a more accurate, lower duration estimate.
