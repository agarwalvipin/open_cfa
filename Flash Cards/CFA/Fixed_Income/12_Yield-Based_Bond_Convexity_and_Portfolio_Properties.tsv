What is <b>Convexity</b> in the context of fixed-income?	Convexity is a measure of the curvature in the relationship between a bond's price and its yield. It quantifies the second-order (non-linear) effect of yield changes on a bond's price and serves as a complementary risk metric to duration.	Fixed_Income::Module_12::Definition
Why is the convexity adjustment necessary when estimating bond price changes?	Duration provides a linear estimate of price change, but the actual price-yield relationship is a convex curve. The convexity adjustment accounts for this curvature, providing a more accurate price estimate, especially for large changes in yield.	Fixed_Income::Module_12::Concept
What is the formula for the <b>Convexity Adjustment</b> to the percentage price change of a bond?	The percentage price change of a bond is estimated by adding the convexity adjustment to the duration estimate:<br><br>\[ \% \Delta PV_{Full} \approx (-\text{AnnModDur} \times \Delta \text{Yield}) + \left[\frac{1}{2} \times \text{AnnConvexity} \times (\Delta \text{Yield})^2\right] \]	Fixed_Income::Module_12::Formula
Is the convexity of an option-free fixed-rate bond typically positive or negative?	For a standard (option-free) fixed-rate bond, convexity is always <b>positive</b>. This is beneficial for investors, as it means the price increase from a yield decrease is larger than the price decrease from a yield increase of the same magnitude.	Fixed_Income::Module_12::Concept
What three bond features lead to greater convexity?	Greater convexity is associated with:<br>1. <b>Longer</b> time-to-maturity<br>2. <b>Lower</b> coupon rate<br>3. <b>Lower</b> yield-to-maturity	Fixed_Income::Module_12::Concept
How is Annualized Convexity (ApproxCon) approximated?	By calculating the bond's price change for a small increase and decrease in yield (PV+ and PV-).<br><br>\[ \text{ApproxCon} \approx \frac{(PV_-) + (PV_+) - [2 \times (PV_0)]}{(\Delta \text{Yield})^2 \times (PV_0)} \]	Fixed_Income::Module_12::Formula
What is <b>Money Convexity (MoneyCon)</b>?	Money Convexity expresses the convexity effect in currency units rather than as a percentage. It is calculated by multiplying the bond's annual convexity by its full price.	Fixed_Income::Module_12::Definition
What is the formula for <b>Money Convexity (MoneyCon)</b>?	\[ \text{MoneyCon} = \text{AnnConvexity} \times PV_{Full} \]	Fixed_Income::Module_12::Formula
How is the change in a bond's price in currency units estimated using both Money Duration and Money Convexity?	By adding the money convexity adjustment to the money duration estimate:<br><br>\[ \Delta PV_{Full} \approx (-\text{MoneyDur} \times \Delta \text{Yield}) + \left[\frac{1}{2} \times \text{MoneyCon} \times (\Delta \text{Yield})^2\right] \]	Fixed_Income::Module_12::Formula
What is the most common method for calculating the duration and convexity of a bond portfolio?	The most common method is the <b>weighted-average method</b>, where the portfolio's duration or convexity is the weighted average of the individual bonds' durations or convexities. The weights are based on each bond's market value as a proportion of the total portfolio market value.	Fixed_Income::Module_12::Concept
What is the formula for portfolio modified duration using the weighted-average method?	The portfolio's modified duration is the weighted average of the modified durations of the individual bonds.<br>\[ \text{Portfolio AnnModDur} = w_1 D_1 + w_2 D_2 + \dots + w_n D_n \]Where <b>w</b> is the weight of each bond and <b>D</b> is its annualized modified duration.	Fixed_Income::Module_12::Formula
What is the formula for portfolio convexity using the weighted-average method?	The portfolio's convexity is the weighted average of the convexities of the individual bonds.<br>\[ \text{Portfolio AnnConvexity} = w_1 C_1 + w_2 C_2 + \dots + w_n C_n \]Where <b>w</b> is the weight of each bond and <b>C</b> is its annualized convexity.	Fixed_Income::Module_12::Formula
What is the primary limitation of using the weighted-average method for portfolio duration and convexity?	This method implicitly assumes a <b>parallel shift</b> in the yield curve, meaning the yields for all maturities change by the same amount. In reality, yield curve shifts are rarely parallel (they can steepen, flatten, or twist).	Fixed_Income::Module_12::Concept
