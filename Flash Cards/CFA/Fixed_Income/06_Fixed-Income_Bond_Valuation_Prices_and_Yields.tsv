What is the <b>market discount rate</b> for a bond?	The rate of return required by investors given the risk of the bond's investment. It is also called the <b>required yield</b> or <b>required rate of return</b>, and is used to discount the bond's future cash flows to find its present value.	Fixed_Income::Module_06::Definition
What is the general formula for calculating a bond's price (PV) on a coupon date?	The price is the present value of all future coupon payments (PMT) and the final principal payment (FV), discounted at the market discount rate (r).<br>\[PV = \frac{PMT_1}{(1+r)^1} + \frac{PMT_2}{(1+r)^2} + \dots + \frac{PMT_N + FV_N}{(1+r)^N}\]	Fixed_Income::Module_06::Formula
What is the relationship between a bond's coupon rate and the market discount rate when the bond trades at <b>par</b>?	When a bond trades at par, its price is equal to its face value (PV = FV).<br><br>This occurs when the bond's <b>coupon rate is equal to the market discount rate</b>.	Fixed_Income::Module_06::Concept
What is the relationship between a bond's coupon rate and the market discount rate when the bond trades at a <b>discount</b>?	When a bond trades at a discount, its price is less than its face value (PV < FV).<br><br>This occurs when the bond's <b>coupon rate is less than the market discount rate</b>.	Fixed_Income::Module_06::Concept
What is the relationship between a bond's coupon rate and the market discount rate when the bond trades at a <b>premium</b>?	When a bond trades at a premium, its price is greater than its face value (PV > FV).<br><br>This occurs when the bond's <b>coupon rate is greater than the market discount rate</b>.	Fixed_Income::Module_06::Concept
What are the three components of a bond's price when it is traded between coupon payment dates?	1. <b>Flat Price (PV<sup>Flat</sup>):</b> The quoted or "clean" price of the bond.<br>2. <b>Accrued Interest (AI):</b> The portion of the next coupon payment owed to the seller.<br>3. <b>Full Price (PV<sup>Full</sup>):</b> The total price paid by the buyer, also known as the invoice or "dirty" price.	Fixed_Income::Module_06::Concept
What is the formula that relates the Full Price, Flat Price, and Accrued Interest of a bond?	The Full Price is the sum of the Flat Price and the Accrued Interest.<br>\[PV^{Full} = PV^{Flat} + AI\]	Fixed_Income::Module_06::Formula
Why are bond prices typically quoted as <b>flat prices</b> instead of full prices?	Flat prices are quoted to avoid misleading investors about the bond's market price trend. If full prices were quoted, investors would see the price rise daily due to interest accrual and then drop suddenly after each coupon payment, even if the yield-to-maturity did not change.	Fixed_Income::Module_06::Concept
How is <b>accrued interest (AI)</b> calculated for a bond?	Accrued interest is calculated by multiplying the coupon payment per period (PMT) by the fraction of the coupon period that has passed since the last payment.<br>\[AI = \frac{t}{T} \times PMT\]<br>Where:<br><b>t</b> = number of days from the prior coupon payment to the settlement date<br><b>T</b> = number of days in the coupon period	Fixed_Income::Module_06::Formula
Describe the <b>30/360</b> and <b>actual/actual</b> day-count conventions.	<b>30/360:</b> Assumes each month has 30 days and each year has 360 days. Commonly used for corporate bonds.<br><br><b>Actual/Actual:</b> Uses the actual number of days in each month and year. Commonly used for government bonds.	Fixed_Income::Module_06::Comparison
How do bond prices and yields-to-maturity relate to each other?	Bond prices and yields-to-maturity have an <b>inverse relationship</b>. When the yield-to-maturity increases, the bond price decreases, and vice versa.	Fixed_Income::Module_06::Concept
What is the <b>coupon effect</b> on bond price volatility?	For a given maturity and yield change, a <b>lower-coupon bond</b> has a greater percentage price change (is more volatile) than a higher-coupon bond. This is because a larger proportion of its total cash flow is received at maturity, which is more heavily discounted.	Fixed_Income::Module_06::Concept
What is the <b>maturity effect</b> on bond price volatility?	Generally, for a given coupon rate and yield change, a <b>longer-term bond</b> has a greater percentage price change (is more volatile) than a shorter-term bond.	Fixed_Income::Module_06::Concept
What is the <b>constant-yield price trajectory</b> of a bond?	It is the path of a bond's price over time as it approaches maturity, assuming its yield-to-maturity remains constant. The price of a discount bond will rise towards par, and the price of a premium bond will fall towards par. This is also known as the "pull-to-par."	Fixed_Income::Module_06::Concept
What is the <b>convexity effect</b> regarding the price-yield relationship of a bond?	The relationship between bond price and yield is not linear, but curved or "convex." For a given change in yield, the percentage price <b>increase</b> (from a yield decrease) is greater in absolute value than the percentage price <b>decrease</b> (from a yield increase).	Fixed_Income::Module_06::Concept
What is <b>matrix pricing</b>?	Matrix pricing is a method used to estimate the price or yield-to-maturity of illiquid bonds or new issues by using the prices and yields of comparable, actively traded bonds that have similar features (e.g., maturity, coupon rate, credit quality).	Fixed_Income::Module_06::Definition
How is <b>linear interpolation</b> used in matrix pricing?	Linear interpolation is used to estimate the YTM for a bond with a maturity that falls between the maturities of two comparable bonds. It calculates a weighted average of the comparable bonds' yields.	Fixed_Income::Module_06::Concept
How can matrix pricing be used for new issues?	Underwriters use matrix pricing to estimate the required <b>yield spread</b> over the benchmark rate for a new bond. They analyze the spreads on comparable bonds from the same issuer or similar issuers to determine an appropriate spread for the new issue.	Fixed_income::Module_06::Concept
