What is <b>Modified Duration (ModDur)</b>?	A measure of a bond's price sensitivity to changes in its yield-to-maturity. It provides a linear estimate of the percentage price change for a 1% change in the bond's yield.	Fixed_Income::Module_11::Definition
What is the formula for <b>Modified Duration (ModDur)</b> based on Macaulay Duration?	Modified duration is calculated by dividing Macaulay duration by one plus the yield per period.<br><br>\[ \text{ModDur} = \frac{\text{Macaulay Duration}}{1 + r} \]<br>Where <b>r</b> is the yield-to-maturity per period.	Fixed_Income::Module_11::Formula
How is Modified Duration used to estimate the percentage change in a bond's full price?	The percentage change in a bond's full price is estimated by multiplying the negative of the annualized modified duration by the change in the annual yield.<br><br>\[ \% \Delta PV_{Full} \approx -\text{AnnModDur} \times \Delta \text{Yield} \]	Fixed_Income::Module_11::Formula
How can <b>Modified Duration</b> be approximated without knowing the Macaulay Duration?	By calculating the bond's price change for a small increase and decrease in yield (PV+ and PV-).<br><br>\[ \text{AnnModDur} \approx \frac{(PV_-) - (PV_+)}{2 \times (\Delta \text{Yield}) \times (PV_0)} \]	Fixed_Income::Module_11::Formula
What is <b>Money Duration (MoneyDur)</b>?	A measure of the price change of a bond in <b>currency units</b> for a 1% change in its yield-to-maturity. It is often called "dollar duration" in the United States.	Fixed_Income::Module_11::Definition
How is <b>Money Duration</b> calculated?	Money Duration is the product of the annualized modified duration and the bond's full price (PV_Full).<br><br>\[ \text{MoneyDur} = \text{AnnModDur} \times PV_{Full} \]	Fixed_Income::Module_11::Formula
How is Money Duration used to estimate the change in a bond's full price in currency units?	The change in the bond's price is estimated by multiplying the negative of the Money Duration by the change in yield.<br><br>\[ \Delta PV_{Full} \approx -\text{MoneyDur} \times \Delta \text{Yield} \]	Fixed_Income::Module_11::Formula
What is the <b>Price Value of a Basis Point (PVBP)</b>?	The <b>PVBP</b> is an estimate of the change in the full price of a bond in currency units for a 1 basis point (0.01%) change in its yield-to-maturity. It is also known as DV01 (dollar value of an 01).	Fixed_Income::Module_11::Definition
How is the <b>Price Value of a Basis Point (PVBP)</b> calculated?	By calculating the bond's price after a 1 bp yield decrease (PV-) and a 1 bp yield increase (PV+), and finding the average change.<br><br>\[ \text{PVBP} = \frac{(PV_-) - (PV_+)}{2} \]	Fixed_Income::Module_11::Formula
What is the Macaulay duration of a <b>zero-coupon bond</b>?	The Macaulay duration of a zero-coupon bond is equal to its <b>time-to-maturity</b>, because it has only one cash flow at maturity.	Fixed_Income::Module_11::Concept
What is the Macaulay duration of a <b>perpetuity</b> (perpetual bond)?	The Macaulay duration of a perpetuity is calculated as:<br><br>\[ \text{MacDur} = \frac{1 + r}{r} \]<br>Where <b>r</b> is the yield per period.	Fixed_Income::Module_11::Formula
What is the Macaulay duration of a <b>floating-rate note (FRN)</b>?	The Macaulay duration for an FRN is the fraction of the coupon period remaining until the next reset date.<br><br>\[ \text{MacDur}_{Floating} = \frac{T - t}{T} \]<br>Where T is the number of days in the coupon period and t is the number of days that have passed.	Fixed_Income::Module_11::Formula
How do a bond's features affect its duration (interest rate risk)?	<b>Coupon Rate:</b> Inverse relationship (lower coupon = higher duration).<br><b>Yield-to-Maturity:</b> Inverse relationship (lower yield = higher duration).<br><b>Time-to-Maturity:</b> Direct relationship (longer maturity = higher duration, with rare exceptions for long-term discount bonds).	Fixed_Income::Module_11::Concept
Describe the "saw-tooth" pattern of a bond's Macaulay duration over time.	Assuming a constant yield, a bond's Macaulay duration decreases smoothly as time passes between coupon dates. Immediately after a coupon payment is made, the duration "jumps" upward. This creates a saw-tooth pattern over the life of the bond.	Fixed_Income::Module_11::Concept
