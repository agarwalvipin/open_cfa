What is <b>Credit Risk</b>?	Credit risk is the risk of economic loss resulting from a borrower's failure to make full and timely payments of interest and/or principal as promised in a debt contract.	Fixed_Income::Module_14::Definition
What are the two key components of <b>Credit Risk</b>?	1. <b>Probability of Default (POD):</b> The likelihood that a borrower will fail to meet its debt obligations.<br>2. <b>Loss Given Default (LGD):</b> The portion of a bond's value an investor will lose if the issuer defaults.	Fixed_Income::Module_14::Concept
What is <b>Loss Given Default (LGD)</b>?	The investor's loss conditional on an issuer's default. It is the amount of exposure at default that is not recovered.	Fixed_Income::Module_14::Definition
How is <b>Loss Given Default (LGD)</b> calculated?	Loss Given Default is the Expected Exposure (EE) multiplied by the loss severity (1 minus the Recovery Rate).<br>\[ LGD = EE \times (1 - RR) \]	Fixed_Income::Module_14::Formula
What is the <b>Recovery Rate (RR)</b>?	The percentage of an outstanding debt claim that is recovered in the event of an issuer's default.	Fixed_Income::Module_14::Definition
What is <b>Expected Loss (EL)</b> and how is it calculated?	The probability-weighted shortfall for a given period. It is the product of the Probability of Default and the Loss Given Default.<br>\[ EL = POD \times LGD \]	Fixed_Income::Module_14::Formula
What is the approximate relationship between <b>Credit Spread</b>, POD, and LGD?	An investor is considered fairly compensated when the credit spread is approximately equal to the expected loss.<br>\[ \text{Credit Spread} \approx POD \times LGD \]	Fixed_Income::Module_14::Formula
What are the key drivers of the <b>Probability of Default (POD)</b>?	The POD is driven by an issuer's ability to service debt, which is assessed using:<br>1. <b>Profitability:</b> Stability and predictability of cash flows.<br>2. <b>Coverage:</b> Sufficiency of cash flows to meet debt payments.<br>3. <b>Leverage:</b> Relative reliance on debt financing.	Fixed_Income::Module_14::Concept
What is <b>Credit Migration Risk</b> (or Downgrade Risk)?	The risk that a bond issuer's creditworthiness deteriorates, leading to a downgrade in its credit rating. This typically causes the bond's yield spread to widen and its price to fall.	Fixed_Income::Module_14::Definition
What are the primary functions of <b>Credit Rating Agencies</b>?	They independently assess issuer credit risk and assign symbol-based <b>credit ratings</b> that reflect the potential risk of default and loss. This allows for easy comparison of creditworthiness across issuers and industries.	Fixed_Income::Module_14::Concept
What are three key limitations or pitfalls of relying solely on credit ratings?	1. <b>Ratings tend to be sticky and lag the market:</b> Credit spreads often change faster than credit ratings.<br>2. <b>Some risks are difficult to capture:</b> Events like debt-financed acquisitions or complex fraud can be hard to anticipate.<br>3. <b>Ratings may involve miscalculations or unforeseen changes:</b> As seen in the 2008 financial crisis with subprime mortgage bonds.	Fixed_Income::Module_14::Concept
What is the difference between an <b>issuer credit rating</b> and an <b>issue credit rating</b>?	An <b>issuer rating</b> (e.g., Corporate Family Rating) typically applies to the issuer's senior unsecured debt and reflects its overall creditworthiness (POD).<br><br>An <b>issue rating</b> refers to a specific financial obligation and is adjusted (notched) up or down from the issuer rating to reflect its seniority and expected LGD.	Fixed_Income::Module_14::Comparison
What is <b>Credit Spread Risk</b>?	The risk of loss due to changes in credit conditions that cause a bond's yield spread to widen. Spread widening leads to a decrease in the bond's price.	Fixed_Income::Module_14::Definition
How does the <b>credit cycle</b> affect credit spreads?	Credit spreads tend to narrow during economic expansions when credit risk is perceived to be low, and widen during economic contractions when credit risk is perceived to be high.	Fixed_Income::Module_14::Concept
What is <b>market liquidity risk</b> in the context of yield spreads?	The risk that the price at which an investor can actually transact (sell) a bond may be lower than the quoted price due to transaction costs, primarily the bid-ask spread. This risk is a component of the overall yield spread.	Fixed_Income::Module_14::Concept
What two issuer-specific factors are key determinants of market liquidity risk?	1. <b>Issuer size:</b> Issuers with a larger total amount of debt outstanding tend to be more liquid.<br>2. <b>Credit quality:</b> Issuers with lower credit quality are generally less liquid, especially during times of market stress.	Fixed_Income::Module_14::Concept
How can the price impact of a change in a bond's credit spread be estimated?	The same duration and convexity formulas used for yield changes can be applied to spread changes. For a small change:<br>\[ \% \Delta PV_{Full} \approx -\text{AnnModDur} \times \Delta \text{Spread} \]	Fixed_Income::Module_14::Formula
How is the <b>convexity adjustment</b> applied to a change in credit spread?	For larger spread changes, the convexity adjustment is added to the duration estimate to improve accuracy.<br>\[ \% \Delta PV_{Full} \approx (-\text{AnnModDur} \times \Delta \text{Spread}) + \left[\frac{1}{2} \times \text{AnnConvexity} \times (\Delta \text{Spread})^2\right] \]	Fixed_Income::Module_14::Formula```
