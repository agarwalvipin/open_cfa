What is the "tenor" of a bond?	The <b>tenor</b> refers to the remaining time until the bond's maturity date.	Fixed_Income::Module_01::Definition
Differentiate between <b>money market securities</b> and <b>capital market securities</b>.	<b>Money market securities</b> are fixed-income securities with a tenor of one year or less at issuance (e.g., Treasury bills, commercial paper).<br><br><b>Capital market securities</b> are bonds with tenors longer than one year at issuance.	Fixed_Income::Module_01::Comparison
What is a <b>perpetual bond</b>?	A less common type of bond that has no stated maturity date.	Fixed_Income::Module_01::Definition
What is the <b>principal</b> or <b>par value</b> of a bond?	The amount the issuer agrees to repay to investors at maturity. It is also referred to as the face value.	Fixed_Income::Module_01::Definition
What are the three main ways a bond's interest (coupon) can be paid?	1. <b>Fixed coupon:</b> A fixed payment paid on specified dates.<br>2. <b>Variable coupon (Floating-Rate Note):</b> A coupon determined and paid on specified dates that resets periodically based on a market reference rate.<br>3. <b>Zero-coupon:</b> Interest is paid as part of a single payment with the principal at maturity.	Fixed_Income::Module_01::Concept
What are <b>Floating-Rate Notes (FRNs)</b>?	FRNs are bonds with variable interest payments. The coupon is determined as a combination of a market reference rate (MRR) and an issuer-specific credit spread.	Fixed_Income::Module_01::Definition
How is the coupon rate for a Floating-Rate Note (FRN) calculated?	The coupon rate for an FRN is the sum of a market reference rate and a credit spread.<br>\[ \text{FRN Coupon Rate} = \text{Market Reference Rate (MRR)} + \text{Credit Spread} \]	Fixed_Income::Module_01::Formula
What are <b>zero-coupon bonds</b> (or pure discount bonds)?	Bonds that do not pay periodic interest. Instead, the interest is paid as part of a single payment with the principal at maturity. They are typically issued at a discount to par.	Fixed_Income::Module_01::Definition
What is the difference between <b>senior debt</b> and <b>junior (subordinated) debt</b>?	<b>Senior debt</b> has priority over other debt claims in the case of bankruptcy or liquidation.<br><br><b>Junior (subordinated) debt</b> claims have a lower priority and are paid only once senior claims are satisfied.	Fixed_Income::Module_01::Comparison
What is a <b>contingency provision</b> in a bond indenture?	A clause in a legal agreement that allows for an action if an event or circumstance occurs. The most common are <b>embedded options</b> like call, put, and conversion options.	Fixed_Income::Module_01::Definition
What is the <b>Current Yield (CY)</b> of a bond and what is its formula?	The current yield is a simple measure of return equal to the bond's annual coupon divided by the bond's price, expressed as a percentage.<br><br>\[ \text{CY} = \frac{\text{Annual Coupon Payment}}{\text{Bond Price}} \]	Fixed_Income::Module_01::Formula
What is the <b>Yield-to-Maturity (YTM)</b> of a bond?	The <b>YTM</b> is the internal rate of return (IRR) on a bond's cash flows. It is the single, uniform interest rate that equates the present value of a bond's future cash flows to its current market price.	Fixed_Income::Module_01::Definition
What three conditions must be met for an investor's actual return to equal the bond's Yield-to-Maturity (YTM)?	1. The investor holds the bond until maturity.<br>2. The issuer makes all promised interest and principal payments as scheduled (no default).<br>3. The investor reinvests all periodic cash flows at the YTM.	Fixed_Income::Module_01::Concept
What is a <b>yield curve</b>?	A graphical depiction of the relationship between the yields-to-maturity (YTM) of an issuer's bonds and their times to maturity, assuming identical features (credit risk, coupon, etc.).	Fixed_Income::Module_01::Definition
What is a <b>bond indenture</b>?	The legal contract that describes the form of a bond, the obligations of the issuer, and the rights of the bondholders. It specifies features, sources of repayment, and covenants.	Fixed_Income::Module_01::Definition
What are the primary sources of repayment for <b>sovereign bonds</b>?	Sovereign bonds are primarily backed by the national government's right to tax economic activity and, in some cases, to print currency.	Fixed_Income::Module_01::Concept
Contrast the sources of repayment for <b>unsecured</b> vs. <b>secured</b> corporate bonds.	<b>Unsecured corporate bonds</b> rely on the operating cash flows of the firm as their sole source of repayment.<br><br><b>Secured corporate bonds</b> also rely on operating cash flows, but offer investors a secondary source of repayment through a legal claim (a <b>lien</b> or <b>pledge</b>) on specific assets, known as <b>collateral</b>.	Fixed_Income::Module_01::Comparison
What are bond <b>covenants</b>?	Legally enforceable rules or terms that borrowers and lenders agree to at the time a bond is issued. They are included in the bond indenture.	Fixed_Income::Module_01::Definition
Differentiate between <b>affirmative</b> and <b>negative</b> bond covenants.	<b>Affirmative covenants</b> specify what issuers are <b>required to do</b>. They are typically administrative in nature (e.g., provide timely financial reports).<br><br><b>Negative covenants</b> specify what issuers are <b>prohibited from doing</b> (e.g., issuing more senior debt).	Fixed_Income::Module_01::Comparison
What is a <b>pari passu clause</b> in a bond indenture?	An affirmative covenant that ensures a debt obligation is treated on "equal footing" with the borrower's other debt obligations of similar seniority.	Fixed_Income::Module_01::Definition
What is a <b>cross-default</b> clause in a bond indenture?	An affirmative covenant which specifies that if a borrower defaults on another one of its debt obligations, it is considered in default on this bond as well.	Fixed_Income::Module_01::Definition
What is a <b>negative pledge clause</b>?	A negative covenant that restricts an issuer's ability to pledge assets as security for other debt, which protects the claims of unsecured bondholders.	Fixed_Income::Module_01::Definition
