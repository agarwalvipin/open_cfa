What is the <b>periodicity</b> of an annual interest rate?	The <b>periodicity</b> is the number of compounding periods in a year. It typically matches the frequency of the bond's coupon payments.	Fixed_Income::Module_07::Definition
What is an <b>effective annual rate</b>?	An effective annual rate is a yield with a <b>periodicity of 1</b>. It represents the total return an investor would earn in a year with a single compounding period.	Fixed_Income::Module_07::Definition
What is a <b>semiannual bond basis yield</b>?	An annual rate with a periodicity of 2, calculated by taking the yield per semiannual period and multiplying it by 2. It is the most common periodicity convention in the US and UK markets.	Fixed_Income::Module_07::Definition
What is the general rule for periodicity conversions?	Compounding more frequently at a lower annual rate corresponds to compounding less frequently at a higher annual rate. For a given return, the stated annual rate and the periodicity are inversely related.	Fixed_Income::Module_07::Concept
What is the general formula for converting an annualized yield from one periodicity to another?	The formula for converting an annual percentage rate (APR) from a periodicity of 'm' to a periodicity of 'n' is:<br>\[\left(1 + \frac{APR_m}{m}\right)^m = \left(1 + \frac{APR_n}{n}\right)^n\]	Fixed_Income::Module_07::Formula
What is a <b>street convention</b> yield?	A yield-to-maturity calculation that assumes payments are made on their scheduled dates, without accounting for weekends and holidays. This is the most common method used in practice.	Fixed_Income::Module_07::Definition
What is a <b>government equivalent yield</b>?	A yield measure that restates a yield-to-maturity calculated on a 30/360 day count basis to one based on an actual/actual day count basis. This allows for a more direct comparison to government bond yields.	Fixed_Income::Module_07::Definition
What is <b>yield-to-call (YTC)</b>?	A yield measure for a callable bond that calculates the bond's yield assuming it is redeemed by the issuer on a specified call date at the specified call price.	Fixed_Income::Module_07::Definition
What is the formula for <b>Yield-to-Call (YTC)</b>?	It is the internal rate of return that equates the bond's price (PV) to the present value of its cash flows until the call date.<br>\[PV = \frac{PMT}{(1+r)^1} + \dots + \frac{PMT + \text{Call Price}}{(1+r)^N}\]<br>Where N is the number of periods to the call date.	Fixed_Income::Module_07::Formula
What is the <b>yield-to-worst (YTW)</b> for a callable bond?	The <b>yield-to-worst</b> is the lowest yield among all the possible yield-to-call dates and the bond's yield-to-maturity. It provides the most conservative measure of return for an investor.	Fixed_Income::Module_07::Definition
What is the <b>option-adjusted price</b> of a callable bond?	The option-adjusted price is the flat price of the callable bond plus the value of the embedded call option.<br>The value of the call option is defined as the price of an otherwise identical option-free bond minus the price of the callable bond.	Fixed_Income::Module_07::Concept
What is the <b>option-adjusted yield</b>?	The required market discount rate at which a bond's price is adjusted for the value of the embedded option. It is the yield on an otherwise identical option-free bond.	Fixed_Income::Module_07::Definition
What is a <b>yield spread</b>?	The difference between a bond's yield-to-maturity and the yield of a benchmark. It is typically quoted in basis points (bps).<br>\[\text{Yield Spread} = \text{Bond YTM} - \text{Benchmark Yield}\]	Fixed_Income::Module_07::Definition
What two components make up a bond's yield-to-maturity?	1. <b>Benchmark Rate:</b> Captures macroeconomic ("top-down") factors like inflation and real growth.<br>2. <b>Spread:</b> Captures microeconomic ("bottom-up") factors specific to the issuer, such as credit risk, liquidity, and taxation.	Fixed_Income::Module_07::Concept
What is the <b>G-spread</b>?	The <b>G-spread</b> is the yield spread in basis points over an actual or interpolated government bond yield for the same maturity.	Fixed_Income::Module_07::Definition
What is the <b>I-spread</b> (interpolated spread)?	The <b>I-spread</b> is the yield spread for a bond over the standard swap rate in that currency for the same tenor. It is commonly used for pricing Euro-denominated corporate bonds.	Fixed_Income::Module_07::Definition
What is the <b>zero-volatility spread (Z-spread)</b>?	The <b>Z-spread</b> is a constant yield spread that must be added to each rate on the benchmark spot curve (e.g., government spot curve) to make the present value of a bond's cash flows equal to its market price. It is also called a "static spread".	Fixed_Income::Module_07::Definition
What is the formula for calculating a bond's price (PV) using the Z-spread?	\[PV = \frac{PMT}{(1+z_1+Z)^1} + \frac{PMT}{(1+z_2+Z)^2} + \dots + \frac{PMT+FV}{(1+z_N+Z)^N}\]<br>Where <b>z<sub>i</sub></b> is the benchmark spot rate for period i, and <b>Z</b> is the Z-spread.	Fixed_Income::Module_07::Formula
What is the <b>option-adjusted spread (OAS)</b>?	The <b>OAS</b> is the Z-spread adjusted for the value of an embedded option. For a callable bond, the OAS is lower than the Z-spread.<br>\[\text{OAS} = \text{Z-spread} - \text{Option Value (in bps per year)}\]	Fixed_Income::Module_07::Formula
