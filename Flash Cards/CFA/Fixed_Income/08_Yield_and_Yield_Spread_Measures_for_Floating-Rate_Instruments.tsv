What is the <b>quoted margin (QM)</b> of a floating-rate note (FRN)?	The <b>quoted margin</b> is the specified spread in basis points that is added to the market reference rate (MRR) to determine the FRN's coupon rate. It is fixed at issuance.	Fixed_Income::Module_08::Definition
What is the <b>required margin</b> or <b>discount margin (DM)</b> of an FRN?	The <b>required margin</b> (or <b>discount margin</b>) is the spread over the MRR that is required by the market to price the FRN at par value on a reset date. It reflects the issuer's current credit risk and can change over time.	Fixed_Income::Module_08::Definition
How does the relationship between Quoted Margin (QM) and Discount Margin (DM) affect an FRN's price on a reset date?	1. If <b>QM > DM</b>, the FRN pays a higher coupon than the market requires, so it will be priced at a <b>premium</b> to par.<br>2. If <b>QM = DM</b>, the FRN pays exactly what the market requires, so it will be priced at <b>par</b>.<br>3. If <b>QM < DM</b>, the FRN pays a lower coupon than the market requires, so it will be priced at a <b>discount</b> to par.	Fixed_Income::Module_08::Concept
What is the simplified pricing formula for a floating-rate note (FRN) on a reset date?	The present value (PV) of an FRN can be calculated as:<br>\[PV = \frac{\frac{(\text{MRR} + \text{QM}) \times FV}{m}}{(1 + \frac{\text{MRR} + \text{DM}}{m})^1} + \dots + \frac{\frac{(\text{MRR} + \text{QM}) \times FV}{m} + FV}{(1 + \frac{\text{MRR} + \text{DM}}{m})^N}\]<br>Where:<br><b>MRR</b> = Market Reference Rate<br><b>QM</b> = Quoted Margin<br><b>DM</b> = Discount Margin<br><b>FV</b> = Face Value<br><b>m</b> = Periodicity<br><b>N</b> = Number of periods to maturity	Fixed_Income::Module_08::Formula
What are the three main differences between money market yields and bond yields?	1. <b>Compounding:</b> Money market yields are annualized but not compounded (simple interest); bond yields are annualized and compounded.<br>2. <b>Periodicity:</b> Money market periodicities depend on the days to maturity; bond periodicities are standardized (e.g., semiannual).<br>3. <b>Basis:</b> Money market instruments are quoted on a discount rate or add-on rate basis, not standard YTM.

What is the difference between a <b>discount rate (DR)</b> and an <b>add-on rate (AOR)</b> for money market instruments?	A <b>discount rate</b> expresses the interest as a percentage of the face value (FV). The interest is included in the face value.<br><br>An <b>add-on rate</b> expresses the interest as a percentage of the initial principal or purchase price (PV). Interest is added to the principal to get the maturity value.	Fixed_Income::Module_08::Comparison
What is the pricing formula for a money market instrument quoted on a <b>discount rate (DR)</b> basis?	\[PV = FV \times \left(1 - \frac{\text{Days}}{\text{Year}} \times DR\right)\]<br>Where:<br><b>PV</b> = Present Value (price)<br><b>FV</b> = Face Value<br><b>Days</b> = Days to maturity<br><b>Year</b> = Days in the year (360 or 365)<br><b>DR</b> = Annual discount rate	Fixed_Income::Module_08::Formula
What is the pricing formula for a money market instrument quoted on an <b>add-on rate (AOR)</b> basis?	\[PV = \frac{FV}{\left(1 + \frac{\text{Days}}{\text{Year}} \times AOR\right)}\]<br>Where:<br><b>PV</b> = Present Value (price)<br><b>FV</b> = Future Value (maturity value)<br><b>Days</b> = Days to maturity<br><b>Year</b> = Days in the year (360 or 365)<br><b>AOR</b> = Annual add-on rate	Fixed_Income::Module_08::Formula
Why does a money market <b>discount rate (DR)</b> understate the investor's true rate of return?	The discount rate formula calculates the interest earned as a percentage of the <b>face value (FV)</b>, not the amount invested (PV). Since PV is less than FV (for a positive DR), the denominator is larger, which understates the actual yield.	Fixed_Income::Module_08::Concept
What is the formula for the <b>add-on rate (AOR)</b> of a money market instrument?	The add-on rate is calculated based on the amount invested (PV).<br>\[AOR = \left(\frac{\text{Year}}{\text{Days}}\right) \times \left(\frac{FV - PV}{PV}\right)\]	Fixed_Income::Module_08::Formula
What is a <b>bond equivalent yield</b> in the context of money market instruments?	A bond equivalent yield is a money market rate stated on a <b>365-day, add-on rate basis</b>. It is used to create a common basis for comparing different money market instruments that may be quoted using different conventions (e.g., discount vs. add-on, 360 vs. 365 days).
