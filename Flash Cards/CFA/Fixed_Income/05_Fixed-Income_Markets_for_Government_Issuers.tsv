Sovereign issuers are distinguished by their legal authority to establish public goods and services and their ability to <b>tax economic activity</b> within their jurisdiction. Their primary repayment sources are taxes, tariffs, and fees.	Fixed_Income::Module_05::Concept
What is the key difference between <b>Developed Market (DM)</b> and <b>Emerging Market (EM)</b> sovereign issuers?	<b>DM issuers</b> are characterized by strong, stable, well-diversified domestic economies and can typically issue default-risk-free debt.<br><br><b>EM issuers</b> are usually characterized by higher growth but less stable and less well-diversified economies, often depending on a dominant industry (e.g., commodities).

What is the role of <b>fiscal policy</b> versus <b>debt management policy</b> in sovereign debt?	<b>Fiscal policy</b> determines the <b>level</b> of sovereign debt through central government spending and taxation.<br><br><b>Debt management policy</b> addresses the <b>composition</b> of sovereign debt (e.g., short-term vs. long-term, fixed vs. floating rate).

What does the concept of <b>Ricardian equivalence</b> suggest about government debt?	It suggests that a government's choice of debt maturity is irrelevant in determining the present value of future tax cash flows, as taxpayers anticipate that government debt will be offset by higher future taxes. This concept relies on several simplifying assumptions, such as perfect capital markets.	Fixed_Income::Module_05::Concept
What are three key benefits of issuing sufficient long-term sovereign government securities?	1. <b>Establishment of a risk-free benchmark:</b> Sovereign yields are used to calculate credit risk premiums for other debt.<br>2. <b>Use in managing and hedging interest rate risk:</b> Used by market participants to manage interest rate risk separately from credit risk.<br>3. <b>Preferred use as collateral:</b> Their high liquidity and safety make them the most common form of collateral in repo and derivative transactions.

How are sovereign bonds typically issued in the primary market?	Sovereign debt is usually issued via a <b>public auction</b> led by the national treasury or finance ministry, in contrast to the underwritten offerings common for corporate debt.	Fixed_Income::Module_05::Concept
Distinguish between <b>competitive bids</b> and <b>non-competitive bids</b> in a sovereign debt auction.	<b>Competitive bids</b> specify an acceptable price (or yield) and the quantity of securities to be purchased. The bidder may not receive any securities if their bid is too low.<br><br><b>Non-competitive bids</b> agree to accept the price determined at the auction and are guaranteed to receive securities.	Fixed_Income::Module_05::Comparison
Compare a <b>single-price auction</b> and a <b>multiple-price auction</b> for sovereign bonds.	In both, the issuer ranks bids by price from highest to lowest. In a <b>single-price auction</b>, all winning bidders pay the same price (the stop yield).<br><br>In a <b>multiple-price auction</b>, winning bidders pay the price they bid, resulting in different prices for the same bond issue.

Who are <b>primary dealers</b>?	A group of financial intermediaries designated by a sovereign government that are required to participate in all government debt auctions with competitive prices. They often serve as the central bank's counterparty in open market operations.	Fixed_Income::Module_05::Definition
What are <b>on-the-run securities</b> versus <b>off-the-run securities</b>?	<b>On-the-run securities</b> are the most recently issued sovereign bonds for a given maturity. They are the most liquid and are used for benchmark yield analyses.<br><br><b>Off-the-run securities</b> are older, seasoned government bonds that trade less frequently.	Fixed_Income::Module_05::Comparison
What are <b>government agencies</b> (quasi-government entities)?	Entities that issue debt to fund the government-sponsored provision of specific public goods or services (e.g., airport authorities, mortgage finance agencies like Ginnie Mae). They often have an explicit or implicit guarantee from the sovereign government.	Fixed_Income::Module_05::Definition
Compare <b>General Obligation (GO) bonds</b> and <b>Revenue bonds</b>.	Both are issued by non-sovereign government authorities.<br><b>GO bonds</b> are unsecured bonds backed by the general taxing power of the issuer.<br><b>Revenue bonds</b> are issued to fund specific projects and are repaid from the income generated by those projects (e.g., tolls from a bridge).

What are <b>supranational organizations</b>?	Organizations created and supported by multiple sovereign governments to pursue a common objective, such as economic development or international trade (e.g., the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Asian Development Bank). They are typically of the highest credit quality.	Fixed_Income::Module_05::Definition
