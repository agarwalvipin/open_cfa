What is a <b>bullet bond</b>?	A standard fixed-coupon bond where the issuer receives the principal at settlement, makes periodic, fixed coupon payments, and repays the entire principal amount at maturity.	Fixed_Income::Module_02::Definition
What is an <b>amortizing bond</b>?	A fixed-income instrument that periodically retires a portion of the principal outstanding prior to maturity. This results in higher near-term cash flows for the investor compared to a bullet bond.	Fixed_Income::Module_02::Definition
Compare a <b>fully amortizing</b> bond vs. a <b>partially amortizing</b> bond.	A <b>fully amortizing</b> bond repays the entire principal amount through a series of periodic payments, with the final payment retiring the remaining principal.<br><br>A <b>partially amortizing</b> bond also makes periodic principal repayments, but a significant portion of the principal, known as a <b>balloon payment</b>, is repaid at maturity.	Fixed_Income::Module_02::Comparison
What is the formula for the periodic payment (A) of a fully amortizing loan or bond?	The formula for the periodic payment is:<br>\[A = \frac{r \times \text{Principal}}{1 - (1 + r)^{-N}}\]<br>Where:<br><b>r</b> = Market interest rate per period<br><b>N</b> = Number of payment periods	Fixed_Income::Module_02::Formula
What is a <b>sinking fund arrangement</b>?	An arrangement where an issuer sets aside funds over time in an escrow account to periodically retire a bond's principal outstanding before maturity. This reduces credit risk but increases reinvestment risk for the investor.	Fixed_Income::Module_02::Definition
What is a <b>waterfall structure</b> in the context of asset-backed securities (ABS)?	A structure for principal repayment where cash flows are distributed to investor classes (tranches) with different priority claims. Principal is repaid sequentially, with the most senior tranche being paid first. This means payment shortfalls are borne by the more junior tranches.	Fixed_Income::Module_02::Concept
What is a <b>step-up bond</b>?	A bond whose coupon increases by specified margins at specified dates. They are used to protect investors against rising interest rates.	Fixed_Income::Module_02::Definition
What is a <b>credit-linked note</b>?	A bond where the coupon changes in response to an event, typically a change in the issuer's credit quality. For example, the coupon may increase if the issuer's credit rating is downgraded.	Fixed_Income::Module_02::Definition
What is a <b>payment-in-kind (PIK)</b> feature?	A feature that allows an issuer to pay interest by increasing the principal amount of the outstanding bond rather than making a cash payment. This is often used by firms with high reliance on debt financing.	Fixed_Income::Module_02::Definition
What are <b>inflation-linked bonds</b> (linkers)?	Bonds that have their interest and/or principal payments linked to a specified price index, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI). They protect investors against rising prices. An example is Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) in the US.	Fixed_Income::Module_02::Definition
Compare <b>capital-indexed bonds</b> and <b>interest-indexed bonds</b>.	<b>Capital-indexed bonds:</b> The principal amount is adjusted for inflation, while the coupon rate is fixed. This protects the real value of the principal (e.g., TIPS).<br><br><b>Interest-indexed bonds:</b> Only the coupon payment is adjusted for inflation; the principal is fixed.	Fixed_Income::Module_02::Comparison
What is a <b>deferred coupon bond</b>?	A bond that pays no interest for the first few years and then pays a higher coupon for the remainder of its life. Issuers use these to conserve cash in the short term.	Fixed_Income::Module_02::Definition
What is a <b>callable bond</b>?	A bond that gives the <b>issuer</b> the right, but not the obligation, to redeem (or "call") all or part of the bond prior to its specified maturity date at a predetermined price (the call price).	Fixed_Income::Module_02::Definition
What is a <b>call protection period</b>?	A specified period during which the call feature on a callable bond cannot be used by the issuer. Also known as a lockout period.	Fixed_Income::Module_02::Concept
What is <b>call risk</b> for an investor?	The risk associated with a callable bond, which includes:<br>1. <b>Uncertain maturity:</b> The bond may be called before maturity.<br>2. <b>Limited price appreciation:</b> The bond's price is effectively capped at the call price as yields fall.<br>3. <b>Reinvestment risk:</b> If called, the investor must reinvest the proceeds at lower interest rates.	Fixed_Income::Module_02::Concept
What is a <b>putable bond</b>?	A bond that gives the <b>bondholder</b> the right, but not the obligation, to sell the bond back to the issuer at a pre-determined price (the put price) on specified dates. This protects the investor if interest rates rise.	Fixed_Income::Module_02::Definition
What is a <b>convertible bond</b>?	A debt instrument that grants the bondholder the right to exchange the bond for a specified number of the issuer's common shares at a predetermined price (the conversion price).	Fixed_Income::Module_02::Definition
What is the formula for the <b>conversion ratio</b> of a convertible bond?	The conversion ratio represents the number of common shares a bondholder receives upon conversion.<br>\[ \text{Conversion Ratio} = \frac{\text{Par Value of Bond}}{\text{Conversion Price}} \]	Fixed_Income::Module_02::Formula
What is the formula for the <b>conversion value</b> of a convertible bond?	The conversion value is the market value of the shares the bondholder would receive upon conversion.<br>\[ \text{Conversion Value} = \text{Conversion Ratio} \times \text{Current Share Price} \]	Fixed_Income::Module_02::Formula
What is a <b>warrant</b> attached to a bond?	A warrant is an "attached" option (traded separately) that gives the bondholder the right to buy the issuer's stock at a fixed exercise price until the expiration date. It is used as a "yield enhancement" for the bond investor.	Fixed_Income::Module_02::Definition
What are <b>Contingent Convertible Bonds (CoCos)</b>?	Bonds that automatically convert from debt to equity if a specified event occurs, such as a bank's core Tier 1 capital ratio falling below a regulatory minimum. Unlike standard convertibles, they convert on the downside to limit systemic risk.	Fixed_Income::Module_02::Definition
Compare <b>domestic bonds, foreign bonds, and Eurobonds</b>.	<b>Domestic Bonds:</b> Issued by an entity incorporated in a country and traded in that same country's market.<br><b>Foreign Bonds:</b> Issued in a country by an entity incorporated in another country (e.g., a Canadian company issuing bonds in Germany).<br><b>Eurobonds:</b> Issued internationally, outside the jurisdiction of any single country, and often denominated in a currency different from that of the country where they are issued (e.g., a US dollar bond issued in London).

What is the tax implication of an <b>Original Issue Discount (OID)</b>?	The OID is the difference between a bond's par value and its original issue price. Tax treatment varies by country. In the US, an investor must recognize a prorated portion of the OID as taxable income each year, even though no cash is received until maturity.	Fixed_Income::Module_02::Concept
