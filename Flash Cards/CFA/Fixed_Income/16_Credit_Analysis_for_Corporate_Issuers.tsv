What are the four key qualitative areas to analyze for corporate creditworthiness?	1. <b>Business Model:</b> The stability and predictability of the company's revenue and margins.<br>2. <b>Industry and Competition:</b> The structure, competitive forces, and long-term growth prospects of the industry.<br>3. <b>Business Risk:</b> Deviations from expected demand, revenue, and margins due to cyclicality, rivalry, etc.<br>4. <b>Corporate Governance:</b> Management's track record, accounting policies, and treatment of debtholders.

Why do secured lenders prefer tangible assets over intangible assets as collateral?	<b>Tangible assets</b> (or hard collateral) are identifiable physical assets like property, plant, and equipment that are easier to value and liquidate in a default scenario.<br><br><b>Intangible assets</b> (or soft collateral) like patents and goodwill are often more difficult to value and sell, providing less certainty of recovery.

What are some corporate governance "red flags" in credit analysis?	- Aggressive or opaque accounting policies<br>- Frequent changes of auditors or CFOs<br>- A history of pursuing strategies that harm debtholders (e.g., large debt-financed acquisitions or special dividends)<br>- Use of significant off-balance-sheet financing	Fixed_Income::Module_16::Concept
What are the four main categories of quantitative financial ratios used in credit analysis?	1. <b>Profitability:</b> Measures the ability to generate stable earnings and cash flow from operations.<br>2. <b>Leverage:</b> Measures the company's relative reliance on debt financing.<br>3. <b>Coverage:</b> Measures the ability to meet periodic interest and principal payments from earnings or cash flow.<br>4. <b>Liquidity:</b> Measures the availability of short-term resources to pay near-term obligations.

What does the <b>EBIT Margin</b> ratio measure?	<b>EBIT Margin</b> measures a company's operating profitability before the impact of interest and taxes. A higher margin indicates more profit available to service debt.<br><br>\[ \text{EBIT Margin} = \frac{\text{Operating Income (EBIT)}}{\text{Revenue}} \]	Fixed_Income::Module_16::Formula
What does the <b>EBIT to Interest Expense</b> ratio measure?	This is a <b>coverage ratio</b> that measures the degree to which operating profit covers periodic interest payments. A higher ratio indicates lower credit risk.	Fixed_Income::Module_16::Concept
What does the <b>Debt to EBITDA</b> ratio measure?	This is a <b>leverage ratio</b> comparing total debt to a measure of cash flow. A higher ratio indicates more leverage and thus higher credit risk. It is a key metric used in loan covenants and by rating agencies.	Fixed_Income::Module_16::Concept
What does the <b>Retained Cash Flow (RCF) to Net Debt</b> ratio measure?	This is a <b>leverage ratio</b> that measures how much debt could be paid off with internally generated cash flow. A higher ratio implies lower leverage and lower credit risk.<br><br><b>RCF</b> is typically defined as Net Cash Flow from Operations minus Dividends.	Fixed_Income::Module_16::Concept
What does a bond's <b>seniority ranking</b> refer to?	The priority of payment in the event of default, with the most senior debt having the first claim on the issuer's cash flows and assets.	Fixed_Income::Module_16::Definition
What is the typical <b>priority of claims</b> in a bankruptcy, from highest to lowest?	1. First Lien / First Mortgage Debt (Highest)<br>2. Senior Secured Debt<br>3. Senior Unsecured Debt<br>4. Senior Subordinated Debt<br>5. Subordinated Debt<br>6. Junior Subordinated Debt (Lowest claim before equity)	Fixed_Income::Module_16::Concept
What is the key difference between <b>secured debt</b> and <b>unsecured debt</b>?	<b>Secured debt</b> has a direct claim (a pledge or lien) on specific assets (collateral), giving the lender a secondary source of repayment in a default.<br><br><b>Unsecured debt</b> represents only a general claim on an issuer's assets and cash flows, ranking behind secured debt.	Fixed_Income::Module_16::Comparison
What is a <b>recovery rate</b>?	The percentage of a creditor's claim that is recovered in the event of default. Recovery rates vary by industry, economic cycle, and, most importantly, by seniority.	Fixed_Income::Module_16::Definition
What is the difference between an <b>issuer credit rating</b> and an <b>issue credit rating</b>?	An <b>issuer credit rating</b> (e.g., Corporate Family Rating) addresses the issuer's overall creditworthiness and typically applies to its senior unsecured debt.<br><br>An <b>issue rating</b> is for a specific debt instrument and is adjusted (notched) from the issuer rating to reflect its seniority and expected LGD.	Fixed_Income::Module_16::Comparison
What is <b>notching</b> in the context of credit ratings?	<b>Notching</b> is the practice by rating agencies of adjusting an <b>issue rating</b> up or down from the <b>issuer credit rating</b> to reflect the seniority, collateral, and other features of a specific bond that affect its loss given default (LGD).	Fixed_Income::Module_16::Definition
What is <b>structural subordination</b>?	A situation in a holding company structure where the debt of operating subsidiaries is serviced by the subsidiary's cash flows before any funds can be "upstreamed" to the parent holding company to service its own debt. This makes debt at the subsidiary level effectively senior to debt at the holding company level.	Fixed_Income::Module_16::Definition
