What is the <b>term structure of interest rates</b>?	The relationship between interest rates (or bond yields) and their times-to-maturity. It is also known as the <b>maturity structure of interest rates</b>.	Fixed_Income::Module_09::Definition
What is a <b>spot rate</b>?	A <b>spot rate</b> is the yield-to-maturity on a zero-coupon bond for a specific maturity. It is also referred to as a "zero rate."	Fixed_Income::Module_09::Definition
What is a <b>spot curve</b>?	A <b>spot curve</b> is a yield curve that graphically plots spot rates against their respective maturities. It is considered the most appropriate curve for pricing bonds because it uses a sequence of risk-free rates with no coupon reinvestment risk.	Fixed_Income::Module_09::Definition
How is a bond's <b>no-arbitrage price</b> calculated using spot rates?	The price is the sum of each of its cash flows (coupons and principal) discounted by the corresponding spot rate for that cash flow's maturity.<br>\[PV = \frac{PMT}{(1+Z_1)^1} + \frac{PMT}{(1+Z_2)^2} + \dots + \frac{PMT+FV}{(1+Z_N)^N}\]<br>Where <b>Z<sub>N</sub></b> is the spot rate for period N.	Fixed_Income::Module_09::Formula
Why is pricing a bond with the spot curve considered to result in a "no-arbitrage" price?	Because if a bond's market price differs from its value calculated using spot rates, an arbitrage opportunity would exist. An investor could buy the underpriced asset and sell the overpriced one to realize a risk-free profit.	Fixed_Income::Module_09::Concept
What is a <b>par rate</b>?	A <b>par rate</b> for a specific maturity is the single yield-to-maturity that makes the price of a bond equal to its par value (i.e., PV = 100). For a bond trading at par, the par rate is also its coupon rate.	Fixed_Income::Module_09::Definition
What is a <b>par curve</b>?	A <b>par curve</b> is a yield curve that plots par rates against their respective maturities. It is constructed from the spot curve.	Fixed_Income::Module_09::Definition
What is an <b>implied forward rate</b> (or forward yield)?	An interest rate for a future period that is calculated from the current spot curve. It is the "breakeven reinvestment rate" that links the return on a shorter-term zero-coupon bond to the return on a longer-term one.	Fixed_Income::Module_09::Definition
What does the notation <b>2y1y</b> for a forward rate mean?	It represents the implied <b>one-year</b> forward rate (the second number, or tenor) for a period beginning <b>two years</b> from today (the first number). It is pronounced "two-year into one-year rate."	Fixed_Income::Module_09::Concept
What is the general formula to calculate an implied forward rate (IFR) from spot rates (Z)?	\[(1+Z_A)^A \times (1+IFR_{A, B-A})^{B-A} = (1+Z_B)^B\]<br>Where:<br><b>Z<sub>A</sub></b> = Spot rate for period A<br><b>Z<sub>B</sub></b> = Spot rate for period B (where B > A)<br><b>IFR<sub>A, B-A</sub></b> = Forward rate for a period of (B-A) years, beginning in A years.	Fixed_Income::Module_09::Formula
How can spot rates be derived from a series of one-period forward rates?	A spot rate for a given maturity is the geometric average of the one-period forward rates up to that maturity.<br>\[(1+Z_N)^N = (1+f_1) \times (1+f_2) \times \dots \times (1+f_N)\]<br>Where <b>f<sub>i</sub></b> is the one-year forward rate for year <i>i</i>.
