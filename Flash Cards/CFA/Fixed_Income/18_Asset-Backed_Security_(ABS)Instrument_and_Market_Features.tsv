What are <b>covered bonds</b>?	Covered bonds are senior debt obligations issued by a financial institution. They are backed by a segregated pool of assets (the "cover pool"), such as mortgages, that <b>remain on the issuer's balance sheet</b>.	Fixed_Income::Module_18::Definition
What is the key difference in recourse between <b>covered bonds</b> and other <b>ABS</b>?	Covered bonds have <b>dual recourse</b>. Investors have a claim on both the segregated cover pool and, if necessary, the unencumbered assets of the issuing financial institution. Other ABS typically only have recourse to the assets within the SPE (single recourse).	Fixed_Income::Module_18::Comparison
What is <b>overcollateralization</b> as a form of credit enhancement?	A provision where the value of the collateral pool is greater than the face value of the securities issued. This provides a cushion to absorb losses from defaults in the underlying assets.	Fixed_Income::Module_18::Definition
What is <b>credit tranching</b> (or subordination)?	An internal credit enhancement that involves creating multiple bond classes or tranches with different seniority levels. Losses are absorbed by the most junior tranches first, thereby protecting the more senior tranches. This is also known as a <b>waterfall structure</b>.	Fixed_Income::Module_18::Definition
What is <b>excess spread</b> as a form of credit enhancement?	The difference between the interest rate received on the underlying collateral and the interest rate paid to the security holders. This extra cash flow can be used to absorb losses or be held in a reserve account.	Fixed_Income::Module_18::Definition
Describe the cash flow structure of a <b>non-amortizing</b> ABS (like a credit card receivable ABS).	It has two distinct periods:<br>1. <b>Lockout (or Revolving) Period:</b> Principal repayments received from the underlying assets are used to purchase new assets, keeping the collateral pool balance stable. Investors receive only finance charges and fees.<br>2. <b>Amortization Period:</b> Principal repayments are passed through to investors to pay down the security's principal.	Fixed_Income::Module_18::Concept
What is a <b>rapid amortization provision</b> in a credit card ABS?	A provision that triggers an early end to the revolving period if specific events occur (e.g., defaults in the pool rise significantly). This accelerates the repayment of principal to security holders to protect them from further credit deterioration.	Fixed_Income::Module_18::Definition
What is a <b>Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO)</b>?	A generic term for a securitization backed by a diversified pool of non-mortgage debt obligations, such as bonds or loans. The CDO redistributes the cash flows from this pool into various tranches.	Fixed_Income::Module_18::Definition
What is a <b>Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO)</b>?	A CDO where the collateral pool consists of leveraged bank loans. This is the most common type of CDO structure.	Fixed_Income::Module_18::Definition
What is a <b>Collateralized Bond Obligation (CBO)</b>?	A CDO where the collateral pool consists of corporate or emerging market bonds.	Fixed_Income::Module_18::Definition
What is the role of a <b>collateral manager</b> in a CDO?	Unlike in a static ABS pool, the collateral manager for a CDO actively buys and sells debt obligations within the collateral pool to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the CDO's obligations and to manage the portfolio's risk.	Fixed_Income::Module_18::Concept
Describe the "equity tranche" in a CLO.	The equity tranche is the most junior tranche in a CLO. It is not rated and does not have a set coupon. It represents a claim on all excess cash flows after the obligations to all debt tranches have been met. It has the highest risk and the highest potential return.	Fixed_Income::Module_18::Concept
What is an <b>overcollateralization test</b> in a CLO?	A coverage test that ensures the principal value of the underlying loan pool does not fall below the total principal value of the outstanding debt tranches. If the test is violated, cash flows are diverted from junior tranches to repay senior tranches until the test is met.	Fixed_Income::Module_18::Concept
