What is the difference between a parameter and a statistic?	A <b>parameter</b> is a quantity computed from or used to describe a population of data (e.g., the population mean, μ).<br>A <b>statistic</b> is a quantity computed from or used to describe a sample of data (e.g., the sample mean, X̄).	Quant_Methods::Module_07::Definition
What is sampling error?	Sampling error is the difference between a sample statistic (e.g., the sample mean) and the true population parameter it is intended to estimate. It arises because a sample is used instead of the entire population.	Quant_Methods::Module_07::Definition
What is simple random sampling?	A sampling method where each element of the population has an equal probability of being selected.	Quant_Methods::Module_07::Definition
What is stratified random sampling?	A sampling method where the population is first divided into subpopulations (strata) based on certain characteristics. Then, a simple random sample is drawn from each stratum. This ensures that subgroups of interest are represented in the sample.	Quant_Methods::Module_07::Definition
What is the Central Limit Theorem?	The Central Limit Theorem states that for a population with any distribution (with mean μ and finite variance σ²), the sampling distribution of the sample mean (X̄) will be approximately normal if the sample size (n) is large (typically n ≥ 30).	Quant_Methods::Module_07::Concept
According to the Central Limit Theorem, what are the mean and variance of the sampling distribution of the sample mean?	The mean of the sampling distribution of the sample mean is equal to the population mean, μ.<br><br>The variance of the sampling distribution of the sample mean is equal to the population variance divided by the sample size, σ²/n.	Quant_Methods::Module_07::Concept
What is the Standard Error of the Sample Mean?	The standard error of the sample mean is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. It measures the typical distance between a sample mean and the population mean.	Quant_Methods::Module_07::Definition
How is the Standard Error of the Sample Mean calculated when the population standard deviation (σ) is known?	\[\sigma_{\bar{X}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\]	Quant_Methods::Module_07::Formula
How is the Standard Error of the Sample Mean estimated when the population standard deviation (σ) is unknown?	It is estimated using the sample standard deviation (s).<br><br>\[s_{\bar{X}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\]	Quant_Methods::Module_07::Formula
What is jackknife resampling?	A resampling technique where samples are created by taking the original observed data sample and leaving out one observation at a time from the set (without replacement). It is often used to reduce the bias of an estimator.	Quant_Methods::Module_07::Definition
