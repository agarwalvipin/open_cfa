What is the formula for the Present Value (PV) of a single cash flow?	\[PV = \frac{FV_N}{(1+r)^N}\]<br>Where:<br><b>FV<sub>N</sub></b> = Future Value after N periods<br><b>r</b> = Rate of return per period<br><b>N</b> = Number of periods	Quant_Methods::Module_02::Formula
How is a zero-coupon bond (discount instrument) valued?	The value of a zero-coupon bond is the present value of its single principal payment (par value) to be received at maturity.<br><br>\[PV = \frac{FV}{(1+r)^N}\]	Quant_Methods::Module_02::Concept
How is a coupon bond valued?	The value of a coupon bond is the sum of the present values of all its future coupon payments plus the present value of its par value.<br><br>\[PV = \sum_{t=1}^{N} \frac{PMT}{(1+r)^t} + \frac{FV}{(1+r)^N}\]<br>Where:<br><b>PMT</b> = Coupon payment per period	Quant_Methods::Module_02::Formula::Concept
What is a perpetual bond (perpetuity) and how is it valued?	A perpetual bond is a bond with no maturity date, which pays a fixed coupon indefinitely. Its value is the present value of the perpetuity of coupon payments.<br><br>\[PV = \frac{PMT}{r}\]	Quant_Methods::Module_02::Formula::Definition
What is the cash flow additivity principle?	The principle states that the present value of any stream of future cash flows is the sum of the present values of the individual cash flows. This principle is crucial for ensuring no-arbitrage conditions in financial markets.	Quant_Methods::Module_02::Concept
How is the value of a stock paying constant dividends (a perpetuity) calculated?	This is an application of the perpetuity formula, often used for valuing preferred stock.<br><br>\[PV_0 = \frac{D}{r}\]<br>Where:<br><b>D</b> = Constant dividend per period<br><b>r</b> = Required rate of return on the stock	Quant_Methods::Module_02::Formula
What is the Gordon Growth Model (or Constant Growth Dividend Discount Model)?	It is a model used to value a stock by assuming its dividends grow at a constant rate (g) indefinitely.<br><br>\[PV_0 = \frac{D_1}{r - g}\]<br>Where:<br><b>D<sub>1</sub></b> = Dividend expected in the next period (D<sub>0</sub> Ã— (1+g))<br><b>r</b> = Required rate of return<br><b>g</b> = Constant dividend growth rate (must be less than r)	Quant_Methods::Module_02::Formula::Definition
How can the required return (r) on a stock be calculated using the Gordon Growth Model?	The required return is the sum of the expected dividend yield and the expected dividend growth rate.<br><br>\[r = \frac{D_1}{PV_0} + g\]	Quant_Methods::Module_02::Formula
How can the implied growth rate (g) of a stock be calculated using the Gordon Growth Model?	The implied growth rate is the required return minus the expected dividend yield.<br><br>\[g = r - \frac{D_1}{PV_0}\]	Quant_Methods::Module_02::Formula
How is the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio related to the Gordon Growth Model?	The forward P/E ratio can be expressed as the expected dividend payout ratio divided by the difference between the required return and the growth rate.<br><br>\[\frac{P_0}{E_1} = \frac{D_1/E_1}{r - g}\]<br>Where:<br><b>P<sub>0</sub>/E<sub>1</sub></b> = Forward P/E ratio<br><b>D<sub>1</sub>/E<sub>1</sub></b> = Expected dividend payout ratio	Quant_Methods::Module_02::Formula::Concept
What is the no-arbitrage condition for implied forward interest rates?	The return from investing for two periods must equal the return from investing for one period and then reinvesting the proceeds for another period at the forward rate. This ensures no riskless profit can be made.<br><br>\[(1+r_2)^2 = (1+r_1)(1+F_{1,1})\]<br>Where <b>F<sub>1,1</sub></b> is the one-year forward rate starting in one year.
