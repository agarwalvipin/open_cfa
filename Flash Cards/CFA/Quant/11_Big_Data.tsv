What is "fintech"?	Fintech refers to technology-driven innovation in the design and delivery of financial services and products. In quantitative analysis, it often relates to the use of advanced analytical tools on large datasets.	Quant_Methods::Module_11::Definition
What are the three "Vs" that characterize Big Data?	1. <b>Volume:</b> The amount of data is extremely large (terabytes, petabytes).<br>2. <b>Velocity:</b> The data are generated and transmitted at high speed, often in real-time.<br>3. <b>Variety:</b> The data come in many different formats, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured.	Quant_Methods::Module_11::Concept
What is the fourth "V" of Big Data that is crucial for inference and prediction?	<b>Veracity</b>, which refers to the credibility and reliability of the data sources. With varied and vast sources, disentangling quality from quantity is a major challenge.	Quant_Methods::Module_11::Concept
What is the difference between traditional data and alternative data?	<b>Traditional data</b> includes sources like corporate financial statements, regulatory filings, and market data (prices, volume).<br><b>Alternative data</b> refers to non-traditional sources such as social media posts, satellite imagery, credit card transactions, web traffic, and sensor data.	Quant_Methods::Module_11::Comparison
What are the three main sources of alternative data?	1. <b>Data generated by individuals</b> (e.g., social media posts, product reviews, search trends).<br>2. <b>Data generated by business processes</b> (e.g., credit card transactions, corporate supply chain data, point-of-sale scanner data).<br>3. <b>Data generated by sensors</b> (e.g., satellite imagery, geolocation data from smartphones, data from the Internet of Things).

What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?	AI refers to computer systems that are capable of performing tasks that traditionally require human intelligence, such as cognitive and decision-making abilities.	Quant_Methods::Module_11::Definition
What is Machine Learning (ML)?	Machine learning is a subset of AI that involves computer-based techniques that "learn" from large amounts of data to identify patterns and make predictions, without being explicitly programmed for that specific task.	Quant_Methods::Module_11::Definition
What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning in ML?	<b>Supervised Learning:</b> The algorithm learns from labeled data, where both inputs and outputs are provided, to model relationships and make predictions on new data.<br><b>Unsupervised Learning:</b> The algorithm is given unlabeled data and seeks to identify underlying patterns or structures within the data, such as grouping similar companies into clusters.	Quant_Methods::Module_11::Comparison
What is "overfitting" in a machine learning model?	Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too precisely, including the noise. An overfitted model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize and make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.	Quant_Methods::Module_11::Definition
What is text analytics?	The use of computer programs to analyze and derive meaning from large, unstructured text- or voice-based datasets, such as company filings, earnings call transcripts, and news articles.	Quant_Methods::Module_11::Definition
What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?	NLP is an application of text analytics and AI that uses insights into the structure of human language to analyze and interpret text- and voice-based data. Applications include sentiment analysis, topic analysis, and speech recognition.	Quant_Methods::Module_11::Definition
