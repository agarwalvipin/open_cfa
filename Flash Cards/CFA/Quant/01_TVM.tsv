What are the three interpretations of an interest rate (r)?	1. <b>Required rate of return:</b> The minimum return an investor must receive to accept an investment.<br>2. <b>Discount rate:</b> The rate used to convert future cash flows to their present value.<br>3. <b>Opportunity cost:</b> The value that investors forgo by choosing one course of action over another (e.g., consuming today vs. investing).	Quant_Methods::Module_01::Concept
What are the components of a required interest rate?	A required interest rate is the sum of the real risk-free rate plus several premiums.<br><br>\[r = \text{Real risk-free rate} + \text{Inflation premium} + \text{Default risk premium} + \text{Liquidity premium} + \text{Maturity premium}\]	Quant_Methods::Module_01::Formula
What is the nominal risk-free rate?	The nominal risk-free rate is the sum of the real risk-free interest rate and the inflation premium. It reflects compensation for forgoing consumption and for the expected loss of purchasing power.<br><br>\[\text{Nominal risk-free rate} \approx \text{Real risk-free rate} + \text{Inflation premium}\]	Quant_Methods::Module_01::Formula::Definition
What is a Holding Period Return (HPR)?	The total return an investor earns over a specific period. It is calculated as:<br><br>\[R = \frac{(P_1 - P_0) + I_1}{P_0}\]<br>Where:<br><b>P1</b> = Price at the end of the period<br><b>P0</b> = Price at the beginning of the period<br><b>I1</b> = Income (dividends or interest) received during the period	Quant_Methods::Module_01::Formula::Definition
When is the Arithmetic Mean return most appropriate to use?	The arithmetic mean is most appropriate for estimating the average return over a <b>single period</b>. It represents the expected return for the next period.	Quant_Methods::Module_01::Concept
When is the Geometric Mean return most appropriate to use?	The geometric mean is most appropriate for measuring the <b>compound rate of growth</b> over multiple periods. It represents the average return that, if earned each period, would result in the same total growth.	Quant_Methods::Module_01::Concept
What is the relationship between the arithmetic mean (AM) and geometric mean (GM)?	The geometric mean is always less than or equal to the arithmetic mean. They are equal only when all returns in the series are identical. The difference between them increases with the volatility of the returns.	Quant_Methods::Module_01::Concept
What does a Money-Weighted Rate of Return measure?	The money-weighted rate of return is the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of an investment. It is the discount rate that equates the present value of all cash inflows with the present value of all cash outflows. It is affected by the timing and amount of cash flows.	Quant_Methods::Module_01::Definition
What does a Time-Weighted Rate of Return measure?	The time-weighted rate of return measures the compound rate of growth of one unit of currency invested in a portfolio during a stated measurement period. It is not sensitive to the timing and amount of cash flows and is the preferred measure for evaluating investment manager performance.	Quant_Methods::Module_01::Definition
How do you annualize a periodic return?	To annualize a return for a period shorter than one year, you compound it by the number of periods in a year.<br><br>\[R_{\text{annual}} = (1 + R_{\text{period}})^c - 1\]<br>Where <b>c</b> is the number of periods in a year (e.g., c=12 for monthly, c=4 for quarterly).	Quant_Methods::Module_01::Formula
What is a continuously compounded return?	The return that results from compounding interest an infinite number of times. The continuously compounded return for a period is the natural logarithm of (1 + Holding Period Return).<br><br>\[r_{c} = \ln(1+R) = \ln(\frac{P_1}{P_0})\]	Quant_Methods::Module_01::Formula::Definition
What is the difference between Gross Return and Net Return?	<b>Gross Return:</b> The return earned by an asset manager before deducting fees for management and administration. It is used to evaluate the manager's investment skill.<br><b>Net Return:</b> The return an investor actually earns after all fees and expenses have been deducted.	Quant_Methods::Module_01::Definition
What is a Real Return?	A real return is a nominal return that has been adjusted for inflation. It represents the increase in an investor's purchasing power.<br><br>\[\text{Real Return} \approx \text{Nominal Return} - \text{Inflation Rate}\]	Quant_Methods::Module_01::Definition
How does leverage affect portfolio returns?	Leveraging a portfolio, via borrowing or using derivatives, amplifies both gains and losses on the investment. The return on a leveraged portfolio is a function of the return on the assets and the cost of borrowing.<br><br>\[R_L = R_p + \frac{V_B}{V_E}(R_p - r_D)\]	Quant_Methods::Module_01::Concept::Formula
