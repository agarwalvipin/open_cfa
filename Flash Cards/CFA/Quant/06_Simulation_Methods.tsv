Why is the lognormal distribution often used to model asset prices?	The lognormal distribution is used because:<br>1. It is bounded below by zero, meaning asset prices cannot be negative.<br>2. It is skewed to the right, which is consistent with the observation that asset prices have unlimited potential upside but limited downside (to zero).	Quant_Methods::Module_06::Concept
What is the relationship between the normal and lognormal distributions for asset prices and returns?	If the continuously compounded returns on an asset are normally distributed, then the future price of that asset is lognormally distributed.	Quant_Methods::Module_06::Concept
What is Monte Carlo simulation?	Monte Carlo simulation is a computer-based technique that generates a large number of random samples from specified probability distributions to model the risk and return of an investment. It is used to obtain the likelihood of a range of outcomes.	Quant_Methods::Module_06::Definition
What are the primary applications of Monte Carlo simulation in investments?	1. <b>Valuing complex securities</b> for which no analytical pricing formula is available (e.g., complex options).<br>2. <b>Estimating the risk of a portfolio</b> (e.g., calculating Value at Risk or VaR).<br>3. <b>Testing the sensitivity of a model</b> to changes in assumptions.	Quant_Methods::Module_06::Concept
What is a key limitation of Monte Carlo simulation?	It provides only statistical estimates, not exact results. The accuracy of the simulation depends on the appropriateness of the assumed probability distributions and the number of trials run. It is also a complement to, not a replacement for, analytical methods where available.	Quant_Methods::Module_06::Concept
What is bootstrapping?	Bootstrapping is a resampling technique where an analyst repeatedly draws samples (called resamples) from the original observed data sample to infer population parameters. It treats the original sample as if it were the population.	Quant_Methods::Module_06::Definition
What is the key difference between Monte Carlo simulation and bootstrapping in terms of data generation?	<b>Monte Carlo simulation</b> generates random variables from a specified theoretical probability distribution (e.g., normal, lognormal).<br><br><b>Bootstrapping</b> generates random variables by drawing directly from the actual historical data (the observed empirical distribution).	Quant_Methods::Module_06::Comparison
When is bootstrapping particularly useful?	It is useful when the underlying distribution of the population is unknown or complex, and no analytical formula for estimating a parameter's standard error is available. It relies on the observed data itself to estimate the sampling distribution.	Quant_Methods::Module_06::Concept
