What is a measure of central tendency?	A measure that specifies where data are centered. The main measures are the arithmetic mean, median, and mode.	Quant_Methods::Module_03::Definition
What is the Arithmetic Mean?	The sum of the observations divided by the number of observations. It is the most frequently used measure of central tendency but is sensitive to extreme values (outliers).	Quant_Methods::Module_03::Definition
What is the Median?	The value of the middle item in a dataset that has been sorted into ascending or descending order. It is not affected by extreme values and is useful for skewed distributions.	Quant_Methods::Module_03::Definition
What is the Mode?	The most frequently observed value in a dataset. A distribution can be unimodal, bimodal, or have no mode. It is the only measure of central tendency that can be used with nominal data.	Quant_Methods::Module_03::Definition
What are quantiles?	Quantiles are location parameters that divide a distribution into a number of equal parts. Examples include quartiles (quarters), quintiles (fifths), deciles (tenths), and percentiles (hundredths).	Quant_Methods::Module_03::Definition
What is the Interquartile Range (IQR)?	The difference between the third quartile (Q3, the 75th percentile) and the first quartile (Q1, the 25th percentile). It measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data.<br><br>\[\text{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1\]	Quant_Methods::Module_03::Definition
What does a measure of dispersion indicate?	It describes the variability of outcomes around the central tendency. Key measures include the range, mean absolute deviation, variance, and standard deviation.	Quant_Methods::Module_03::Definition
What is the formula for sample variance (sÂ²)?	Sample variance is the average of the squared deviations from the sample mean. The divisor is n-1.<br><br>\[s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i - \bar{X})^2}{n-1}\]	Quant_Methods::Module_03::Formula
What is the sample standard deviation (s)?	The positive square root of the sample variance. It is a measure of dispersion expressed in the same units as the original data.<br><br>\[s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i - \bar{X})^2}{n-1}}\]	Quant_Methods::Module_03::Formula
What is Skewness?	Skewness describes the degree to which a distribution is asymmetric about its mean.<br><b>Positive Skewness (Right Skew):</b> Frequent small losses and a few extreme gains. Mean > Median > Mode.<br><b>Negative Skewness (Left Skew):</b> Frequent small gains and a few extreme losses. Mean < Median < Mode.	Quant_Methods::Module_03::Definition
What is Kurtosis?	Kurtosis measures the combined weight of the tails of a distribution relative to the rest of the distribution. It indicates the propensity for extreme outcomes.<br><b>Leptokurtic:</b> Fatter tails than a normal distribution (Kurtosis > 3, Excess Kurtosis > 0).<br><b>Platykurtic:</b> Thinner tails than a normal distribution (Kurtosis < 3, Excess Kurtosis < 0).<br><b>Mesokurtic:</b> Same tails as a normal distribution (Kurtosis = 3, Excess Kurtosis = 0).	Quant_Methods::Module_03::Definition
What does the Coefficient of Variation (CV) measure?	It measures the amount of dispersion in a distribution relative to its mean. It is a scale-free measure of risk per unit of return and is useful for comparing the relative dispersion of datasets with different means.<br><br>\[CV = \frac{s}{\bar{X}}\]	Quant_Methods::Module_03::Formula::Concept
What is covariance?	Covariance measures how two variables move together. A positive covariance indicates the variables tend to move in the same direction, while a negative covariance indicates they move in opposite directions. Its value is unbounded and depends on the units of the variables.	Quant_Methods::Module_03::Definition
What is the correlation coefficient (r)?	The correlation coefficient is a standardized measure of the linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to +1.<br><b>+1:</b> Perfect positive linear relationship.<br><b>-1:</b> Perfect negative linear relationship.<br><b>0:</b> No linear relationship.	Quant_Methods::Module_03::Definition
What is the relationship between covariance and correlation?	Correlation is the covariance divided by the product of the standard deviations of the two variables.<br><br>\[r_{XY} = \frac{Cov(X,Y)}{s_X s_Y}\]	Quant_Methods::Module_03::Formula
What is spurious correlation?	A correlation that reflects a chance relationship in a particular dataset, is induced by a calculation that mixes variables with a third variable, or arises from a relationship with a third variable. It does not reflect a true causal relationship.	Quant_Methods::Module_03::Definition
