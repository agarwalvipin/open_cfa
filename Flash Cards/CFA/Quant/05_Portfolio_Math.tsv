How is the expected return of a portfolio calculated?	The expected return of a portfolio is the weighted average of the expected returns of the individual securities in the portfolio.<br><br>\[E(R_p) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i E(R_i)\]<br>Where:<br><b>w<sub>i</sub></b> = the weight of asset i in the portfolio<br><b>E(R<sub>i</sub>)</b> = the expected return of asset i	Quant_Methods::Module_05::Formula
What is the formula for the variance of a two-asset portfolio?	The variance of a two-asset portfolio is a function of the variances of the individual assets and the covariance between them.<br><br>\[\sigma^2(R_p) = w_A^2\sigma^2(R_A) + w_B^2\sigma^2(R_B) + 2w_A w_B Cov(R_A, R_B)\]	Quant_Methods::Module_05::Formula
How can the formula for the variance of a two-asset portfolio be expressed using correlation?	By substituting Cov(R<sub>A</sub>,R<sub>B</sub>) with ρ<sub>AB</sub>σ<sub>A</sub>σ<sub>B</sub>.<br><br>\[\sigma^2(R_p) = w_A^2\sigma^2(R_A) + w_B^2\sigma^2(R_B) + 2w_A w_B \rho_{AB}\sigma_A \sigma_B\]	Quant_Methods::Module_05::Formula
How does correlation between assets affect portfolio variance?	The lower the correlation between the assets in a portfolio, the lower the portfolio variance, and thus the greater the diversification benefits. Diversification benefits are maximized when the correlation is -1.	Quant_Methods::Module_05::Concept
What is shortfall risk?	Shortfall risk is the risk that a portfolio's value or return will fall below a specified minimum acceptable level (the shortfall level, R<sub>L</sub>) over a given time horizon.	Quant_Methods::Module_05::Definition
What is Roy's Safety-First Criterion?	Roy's safety-first criterion states that the optimal portfolio is the one that minimizes the probability that the portfolio return, R<sub>p</sub>, will fall below a specified threshold level, R<sub>L</sub>.	Quant_Methods::Module_05::Concept
What is the Safety-First Ratio (SFRatio)?	The SFRatio is used to select the optimal portfolio according to Roy's criterion. The portfolio with the highest SFRatio is the one that minimizes the probability of falling below the threshold return.<br><br>\[\text{SFRatio} = \frac{E(R_p) - R_L}{\sigma_p}\]	Quant_Methods::Module_05::Formula::Definition
What is the relationship between the Safety-First Ratio and the Sharpe Ratio?	When the threshold level of return (R<sub>L</sub>) is the risk-free rate (R<sub>f</sub>), the Safety-First Ratio is equivalent to the Sharpe Ratio.	Quant_Methods::Module_05::Concept
