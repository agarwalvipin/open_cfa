What does a test concerning a correlation coefficient typically assess?	It typically tests the null hypothesis that the population correlation coefficient (ρ) is equal to zero, against the alternative that it is not equal to zero. This assesses whether a statistically significant linear relationship exists between two variables.	Quant_Methods::Module_09::Concept
What is the t-statistic used for testing the significance of a correlation coefficient?	The formula for the t-test is:<br><br>\[t = \frac{r\sqrt{n-2}}{\sqrt{1-r^2}}\]<br>This statistic is t-distributed with n-2 degrees of freedom, where 'r' is the sample correlation coefficient and 'n' is the number of observations.	Quant_Methods::Module_09::Formula
What is the Spearman rank correlation coefficient?	It is a nonparametric measure of the correlation between two variables. It is calculated based on the ranks of the data rather than the actual data values. It is used when the data do not meet the assumptions of the parametric Pearson correlation test (e.g., are not normally distributed) or when the relationship is nonlinear but monotonic.

What is the test of independence for categorical data?	A test used to determine whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables.	Quant_Methods::Module_09::Concept
What is a contingency table?	A contingency table (or two-way table) is a tabular representation of categorical data. It is used to display the frequency distribution of variables, which is the basis for conducting a chi-square test of independence.	Quant_Methods::Module_09::Definition
What test statistic is used for a test of independence based on a contingency table?	The chi-square (χ²) test statistic is used. It compares the observed frequencies in the contingency table to the frequencies that would be expected if the variables were independent.<br><br>\[\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}\]	Quant_Methods::Module_09::Formula
How are the degrees of freedom for a chi-square test of independence calculated?	The degrees of freedom are calculated based on the dimensions of the contingency table.<br><br>\[df = (\text{number of rows} - 1) \times (\text{number of columns} - 1)\]	Quant_Methods::Module_09::Formula
