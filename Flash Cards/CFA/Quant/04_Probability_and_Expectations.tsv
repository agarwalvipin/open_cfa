What is the Expected Value of a random variable?	The expected value, E(X), is the probability-weighted average of the possible outcomes of the random variable.<br><br>\[E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P(X_i)X_i\]<br>It is the forecast or "true" population mean of the variable.

What is the formula for the Variance of a random variable?	The variance, σ²(X), is the expected value of the squared deviations from the random variable’s expected value.<br><br>\[\sigma^2(X) = E\{[X - E(X)]^2\} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P(X_i)[X_i - E(X)]^2\]	Quant_Methods::Module_04::Formula
What is a conditional probability?	A conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. It is denoted P(A|B) - "the probability of A given B".	Quant_Methods::Module_04::Definition
What is the Total Probability Rule for Expected Value?	It states that the expected value of a random variable can be expressed as the weighted average of the conditional expected values of the variable, where the weights are the probabilities of the conditioning events.<br><br>\[E(X) = E(X|S_1)P(S_1) + E(X|S_2)P(S_2) + \dots + E(X|S_n)P(S_n)\]	Quant_Methods::Module_04::Concept::Formula
What is the purpose of a probability tree?	A probability tree is a graphical tool used to illustrate the results of two or more sequential events or scenarios, showing the paths and probabilities of each outcome.	Quant_Methods::Module_04::Concept
What is Bayes' Formula used for?	Bayes' formula is used to update a prior probability for an event based on the arrival of new information. It calculates a posterior probability.	Quant_Methods::Module_04::Concept
What is the general formula for Bayes' Formula?	It updates the probability of an event given new information.<br><br>\[P(\text{Event}|\text{Information}) = \frac{P(\text{Information}|\text{Event})}{P(\text{Information})} \times P(\text{Event})\]<br>Where:<br>P(Event) is the prior probability.<br>P(Event|Information) is the posterior probability.	Quant_Methods::Module_04::Formula
In Bayes' Formula, what is a "prior probability"?	A prior probability is the original, unconditional probability of an event before any new information is considered.	Quant_Methods::Module_04::Definition
In Bayes' Formula, what is a "posterior probability"?	A posterior probability is the updated probability of an event after new information has been taken into account.	Quant_Methods::Module_04::Definition
