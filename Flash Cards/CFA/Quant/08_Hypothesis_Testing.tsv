What are the two main types of hypotheses in hypothesis testing?	1. <b>Null Hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>):</b> The hypothesis that the researcher wants to reject. It is a statement that is assumed to be true unless there is convincing evidence to the contrary. It always contains some form of equality (=, ≤, or ≥).<br>2. <b>Alternative Hypothesis (H<sub>a</sub>):</b> The hypothesis that the researcher is trying to prove. It is accepted if the null hypothesis is rejected.	Quant_Methods::Module_08::Definition
What is a test statistic?	A quantity, calculated from a sample, whose value is the basis for deciding whether to reject or not reject the null hypothesis. It is compared to a critical value.	Quant_Methods::Module_08::Definition
What is a Type I error in hypothesis testing?	A Type I error is the rejection of a true null hypothesis. The probability of a Type I error is denoted by α (alpha) and is equal to the significance level of the test.	Quant_Methods::Module_08::Definition
What is a Type II error in hypothesis testing?	A Type II error is the failure to reject a false null hypothesis. The probability of a Type II error is denoted by β (beta).	Quant_Methods::Module_08::Definition
What is the significance level (α) of a test?	The significance level (alpha) is the probability of making a Type I error (rejecting a true null hypothesis). It is a threshold set by the researcher (e.g., 0.05 or 5%).	Quant_Methods::Module_08::Definition
What is the power of a test?	The power of a test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. It is calculated as 1 - β, where β is the probability of a Type II error.	Quant_Methods::Module_08::Concept
What is a p-value?	The p-value is the smallest level of significance (α) at which the null hypothesis can be rejected. If the p-value is less than the significance level, we reject the null hypothesis.	Quant_Methods::Module_08::Definition
What is the decision rule in hypothesis testing?	If the |Test Statistic| > |Critical Value|, we reject the null hypothesis.<br>If the p-value < Significance Level (α), we reject the null hypothesis.	Quant_Methods::Module_08::Concept
What is the difference between a parametric test and a nonparametric test?	<b>Parametric tests</b> are hypothesis tests that concern a population parameter and/or make specific assumptions about the distribution of the population (e.g., it is normal).<br><b>Nonparametric tests</b> are either not concerned with a parameter or make minimal assumptions about the population distribution. They are often used when data do not meet distributional assumptions (e.g., are not normal) or are given in ranks.	Quant_Methods::Module_08::Comparison::Definition
When would you use a t-test for the difference in means between two independent samples?	When you are testing if the means of two approximately normally distributed populations are equal, the population variances are unknown but assumed to be equal, and the samples are independent. The test uses a pooled estimate of the common variance.	Quant_Methods::Module_08::Concept
When would you use a paired comparisons test (a test of mean differences)?	When the two samples are dependent (not independent), meaning the data are arranged in paired observations (e.g., before-and-after measurements on the same subjects).	Quant_Methods::Module_08::Concept
What test statistic is used for tests concerning a single population variance?	The chi-square (χ²) statistic is used.<br><br>\[\chi^2 = \frac{(n-1)s^2}{\sigma_0^2}\]<br>with n-1 degrees of freedom.	Quant_Methods::Module_08::Formula
What test statistic is used for tests concerning the equality of two population variances?	The F-statistic is used, which is the ratio of the sample variances.<br><br>\[F = \frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2}\]<br>with n<sub>1</sub>-1 numerator and n<sub>2</sub>-1 denominator degrees of freedom.
