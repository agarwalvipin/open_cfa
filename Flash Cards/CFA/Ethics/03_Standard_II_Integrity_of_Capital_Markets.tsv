What is the core requirement of Standard II(A) Material Nonpublic Information?	Members and Candidates who possess material nonpublic information that could affect the value of an investment must not act or cause others to act on the information.	Ethics::Module_03::Standard_II(A)::Concept
How is "material" information defined?	Information is <b>material</b> if its disclosure would likely impact a security's price or if a reasonable investor would want to know it before making an investment decision. Key factors are its specificity, difference from public information, nature, and reliability.	Ethics::Module_03::Standard_II(A)::Definition
When is information considered "nonpublic"?	Information is <b>nonpublic</b> until it has been disseminated or is available to the marketplace in general. Information made available to a select group of analysts is still considered nonpublic until it is made available to all investors.	Ethics::Module_03::Standard_II(A)::Definition
What is the "mosaic theory"?	Under the <b>mosaic theory</b>, a financial analyst is free to act on a collection (or mosaic) of public and nonmaterial nonpublic information without violating Standard II(A). The analyst's conclusion might be material, but it was derived through skillful analysis of public and non-consequential private information.	Ethics::Module_03::Standard_II(A)::Concept
What should a member do upon determining they possess material nonpublic information?	The member should make reasonable efforts to achieve public dissemination of the information, typically by encouraging the issuing company to make it public. If this isn't possible, the member must not trade on the information or communicate it to anyone other than designated supervisory and compliance personnel.	Ethics::Module_03::Standard_II(A)::Concept
What is a "firewall" in the context of Standard II(A)?	A <b>firewall</b> is an information barrier designed to prevent the communication of material nonpublic information within a firm. It restricts the flow of confidential information to only those who need it to perform their jobs.	Ethics::Module_03::Standard_II(A)::Definition
What is the core requirement of Standard II(B) Market Manipulation?	Members and Candidates must not engage in practices that distort prices or artificially inflate trading volume with the intent to mislead market participants.	Ethics::Module_03::Standard_II(B)::Concept
What are the two general types of market manipulation?	1. <b>Information-Based Manipulation:</b> Includes spreading false rumors or misleading information to induce trading.<br>2. <b>Transaction-Based Manipulation:</b> Involves trades that deceive market participants by distorting the price-setting mechanism (e.g., creating the appearance of activity or price movement).	Ethics::Module_03::Standard_II(B)::Comparison
What is an example of information-based manipulation?	A common example is a "pump-and-dump" scheme, where a member issues misleadingly positive information to "pump up" an investment's price, only to "dump" (sell) it after others have bought in at an artificially high level.	Ethics::Module_03::Standard_II(B)::Concept
Does a legitimate trading strategy based on perceived market inefficiencies violate Standard II(B)?	No. Standard II(B) is not intended to preclude transactions based on legitimate trading strategies that capitalize on perceived market inefficiencies. The <b>intent</b> of the action is critical to determining whether it is a violation.	Ethics::Module_03::Standard_II(B)::Concept
